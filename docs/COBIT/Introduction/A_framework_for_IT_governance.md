# A framework for IT governance
========================


As per File [here](/files/COBIT_2019_Framework_Introduction_and_Methodology.pdf)

Today's information and technology environment is complex. With the drive to create value and be competitive, balanced against the needs to be compliant with laws, rules, and regulations, organizations need best practice frameworks as a means of creating and maintaining their governance and management systems. 

While there are many frameworks to choose from in the IT industry today, COBIT stands out as the only framework that focuses on the governance and management of enterprise information and technology. 

COBIT originally stood for Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies. 

But today it simply goes by COBIT. 

COBIT helps align the business and IT so that everyone is working towards the same goals and ultimately stakeholder needs are met.

It offers a tailorable governance system for any size or type of organization. 

COBIT was developed by ISACA, an international professional organization that provides IT professionals with knowledge and credentials in governance, risk, privacy, compliance, and assurance. 

ISACA has chapters around the globe and you can find out more information at isaca.org. 

It's difficult to thumb through any [framework book](/files/COBIT_2019_Framework_Introduction_and_Methodology.pdf) and say, "Aha, I get it." Sometimes it's helpful to have its contents and uses explained in a manner that is helpful and easy to understand. 

That is what this course will do for you.
