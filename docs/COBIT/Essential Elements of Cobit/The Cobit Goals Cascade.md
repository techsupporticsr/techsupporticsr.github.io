# The Cobit Goals Cascade
========================

## The best-kept secret in COBIT

Stakeholder needs must be transformed into an enterprises actionable strategy. 

The COBIT Goals Cascade supports enterprise goals, which is one of the key design factors for a governance system. 

It also supports prioritization of governance and management objectives based on prioritization of enterprise goals. 

Enterprise strategy is realized by the achievement of these goals. 

They are defined in the COBIT framework.

There are several benefits to using this goals cascade. 

1. It can assist in the prioritization of which governance or management objectives are most valuable in support of creating value for the enterprise. 

2. It allows a mapping and prioritization to multiple components in an organization such as processes, policies, key services, and individual goals. 

3. It can assist in decision making regarding funding and resource allocation. 

I call this the best kept secret in COBIT because this method can allow any individual or department to literally map their goals to those of the enterprise. Yet few actually do this. 

The goals cascade is a model that allows for the direct mapping of stakeholder drivers and needs all the way down to specific governance and management objectives and therefore, specific processes that are the most appropriate for value achievement. 

This model starts by mapping stakeholder drivers in these directly into the cascade. 

COBIT does not provide this cascade because every enterprise has different drivers and needs, but it does offer mapping tables for the remainder of this model. 

What stakeholder drivers and needs are associated with enterprise goals, these map to alignment goals, which finally map to governance and management objectives. 

For example, if your organization has a set of enterprise goals or unique drivers and needs, you can map these directly into the generic goals cascade provided by COBIT. 

I recently worked with an organization that presumed this model was too generic because they were unique. 

After identifying their specific company goals, we could map those into this model, which allowed them to identify which of the governance and management objectives would be most beneficial to their success. 

COBIT identifies a set of 13 generic enterprise goals with a number of accompanying metrics for each. 

These goals are organized into four major segments, known as the balanced scorecard dimensions. 

This allows for a holistic view of achievements that consider all value dimensions in the organization. 

You can determine the importance of each of these enterprise goals by mapping your specific stakeholder needs and drivers directly to these. 

Each of these enterprise goals is mapped to what are called alignment goals, using primary and secondary relationships. 


Here's a full list of generic enterprise goals.

Can you change these to fit your needs? You certainly can. That is how this framework is flexible. 

You can add, remove, or modify any part of this framework to meet your specific needs.
 
The goals cascade further supports translation of enterprise goals into priorities for alignment goals. 

Alignment goals emphasize the alignment of all IT efforts with governance and management objectives. 

Each goal also includes example metrics, and COBIT provides an example of this mapping using primary and secondary relationships between each goal.
 
Alignment goals can then be mapped to specific governance and management objectives. 

Here's a full list of these generic alignment goals.

You may recognize these as IT related goals from earlier versions of COBIT, as with all areas of this goals cascade, goals can be added, removed, or modified to fit your particular enterprise needs. 

Alignment goals then map to specific governance and management objectives. 

By using this goals cascade, you can determine which objective and therefore which processes are the most beneficial to not only supporting enterprise goals, but meeting stakeholder needs. 

These are the 40 governance and management objectives located in the COBIT core and each of these objectives relates to a process in the COBIT framework. 

By linking the various levels of goals in this goals cascade, organizations can determine which of these objectives have the most significant impact on meeting stakeholder drivers and enterprise goals and therefore, how and where to focus their resources.
