# Using principles as guides to adoption
========================



I experienced a unique situation where my company had a major incident which triggered a new desire by the board of directors to formally identify and document our governance system over information and technology. 

We knew that it would not be wise to jump into a governance implementation without some type of high level rules. 

Therefore, the board determined a set of principles that would guide our governance framework, and they looked very similar to the COBIT principles. 

Principles are important for any framework adoption. A principal is a fundamental guide that serves as a foundation for a system. 

COBIT 2019 is based on two sets of principles, principles that describe the core requirements of a governance system, or enterprise information and technology, and principles for a governance framework that can be used to build a governance system for the enterprise. 

Let's start with the governance system principles first. 

Governance system principles are the core requirements for a governance system for enterprise information and technology. 

Think about what my board was looking for in the previous slide.

These include the following, 

## provide stakeholder value. 

Each enterprise needs a governance system to satisfy stakeholder needs and to generate value from the use of information and technology. 

## A holistic approach. 

A governance system for enterprise information and technology is built from a number of components that can be of different types, and that work together in a holistic way. 

## A dynamic governance system. 

This means that each time one or more of the design factors are changed. For example, a change in strategy, risks, or technology. 

The impact of these changes on the governance system must also be considered. 

## Having governance distinct from management. 

A governance system should clearly distinguish between governance and management activities and structures. 

## Tailored to meet enterprise needs. 

A governance system should be customized to the enterprise's needs using a set of design factors as parameters to customize and prioritize the governance system components. 

Finally, 

## end-to-end governance system. 

A governance system should cover the enterprise end-to-end focusing not only on the IT function, but on all technology and information processing regardless of its location in the enterprise. 



## The 3 principles of a governance framework 

identify the underlying principles for a governance framework that can be used to build a governance system for the enterprise. 

These include, 

### a governance framework should be based on a conceptual model, 

identifying the key components in relationships among components to maximize consistency, and allow automation. 

### A governance framework should be open and flexible. 

It should allow the addition of new content, and the ability to address new issues in the most flexible way, while maintaining integrity and consistency. 

### a governance framework should align to relevant major standards and frameworks as well as industry bodies of knowledge, best practices, and methodologies. 

COBIT is built on these two sets of principles it's important to keep these in mind, as you build both your governance system, and the framework to satisfy that system. 

These are overarching rules that can guide you in any circumstance and can allow for a customized and tailored governance program in your enterprise.
