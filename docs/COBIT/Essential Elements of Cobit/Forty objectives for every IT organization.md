# Forty objectives for every IT organization
========================





![img](/img/Cobit_Domains.png)
 
For information and technology to contribute to enterprise goals, a number of governance and management objectives should be achieved. 

The COBIT Core contains 40 governance and management objectives, and they are illustrated in what's called the COBIT Core. 

Each governance or management objective always relates to one process and a series of related components. 

A governance objective relates to a governance process, while a management objective relates to a management process. 

Boards and executive management are typically accountable for the governance processes, while management processes are the domain of senior and middle management. 

The governance and management objectives in COBIT are grouped into five domains. 

The domains have names with verbs that express the key purpose and areas of activity of the objective contained in them. 

## Governance objectives 

are grouped in the 

## evaluate, direct, and monitor, or EDM, domain. 

In this domain, the governing body evaluates strategic options, directs senior management on the chosen strategic options, and monitors the achievement of strategy. 

## Management objectives 

are grouped into four domains. 

## Align, plan, and organize, or APO, 

addresses the overall organization, strategy, and supporting activities for information and technology. Think of this as the plan domain. 

## Build, acquire, and implement, or BAI, 

treats the definition, acquisition, and implementation of information and technology solutions and their integration in business processes. Think of this as the build domain. 

## Deliver, service, and support, or DSS, 

addresses the operational delivery and support of information and technology services, including security. Think of this as the run domain. Finally, 

## monitor, evaluate, and assess, or MEA, 

addresses performance monitoring, and conformance of information and technology with internal performance targets, internal control objectives, and external requirements. Think of this as the monitor domain. 

# The COBIT Core Model outlines the 40 governance and management objectives.

Each of these are associated with a process. This is what I personally refer to as the box of boxes. 

Across the top is the 

### EDM domain with five governance objectives. 

Below EDM, there is 

### APO with 14 management objectives, 

### BAI with 11 management objectives, 

### DSS with six management objectives,

### MEA with four management objectives. 

Each of these objectives has a three-letter identifier that designates which domain they are aligned to, as well as a number indicating its order in the domain. For example, BAI06, Managed Changes, is the sixth objective in the BAI domain. In the "Governance and Management Objectives" publication, each of these objectives is described in great detail in the following ways. High-level information, goals cascade, related components, and related guidance. The high-level information for each objective includes domain name, for example, APO, BAI, and so on, the focus area, objective name, description, and purpose statement. Next, COBIT identifies the relevant goals cascade information, which includes the applicable alignment goals, enterprise goals, and example metrics for each. COBIT provides detailed information for each governance and management objective broken down into each of the components. Remember, these components are what I call ingredients of a governance system, and they include processes, organizational structures, information flows and items, people skills and competencies, principles, policies, and procedures, culture, ethics, and behavior, and services, infrastructure, and applications. Finally, related guidance is provided for each governance and management objective. These are areas such as standards, frameworks, and compliance requirements, and detailed references. 

This related guidance is found under each of the applicable components in every governance and management objective.
