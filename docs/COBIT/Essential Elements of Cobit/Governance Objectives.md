# Governance Objectives
========================





![img](/img/Cobit_Domains.png)
 
Governance objectives are grouped in the Evaluate, Direct, and Monitor, or EDM domain. 

In this domain, the governing body evaluates strategic options, directs senior management on the chosen strategic options, and monitors the achievement of strategy. 

There are five objectives in the governance domain. 

These are called governance objectives and these include: 

### EDM01 - Ensured Governance Framework Setting and Maintenance. 

### EDM02 - Ensured Benefits Delivery. 

### EDM03 - Ensured Risk Optimization. 

### EDM04 - Ensured Resource Optimization.

### EDM05 - Ensured Stakeholder Engagement. 

Detailed information on each of these governance objectives can be found in the COBIT Governance and Management Objectives publication. 

COBIT identifies these objectives with the highest level of governing bodies in most organizations, for example, the board of directors. However, these can be helpful for any level of governing body in an organization to understand the key areas of consideration when conducting governance activities.
