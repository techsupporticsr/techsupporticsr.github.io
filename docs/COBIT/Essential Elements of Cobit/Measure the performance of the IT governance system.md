# Measure the performance of the IT governance system
========================

## COBIT Performance Management 

refers to how well the governance and management system and all the components of an enterprise work and how they can be improved up to the required level. 

The term COBIT Performance Management, or CPM, is used to describe these activities, and the concept is an integral part of the COBIT framework. 

COBIT Performance Management is based on the following principles. 

It should be simple to understand and use. 

It should be consistent with and support the COBIT conceptual model. 

It should provide reliable, repeatable and relevant results.
 
It must be flexible so it can support the requirements of different organizations with different priorities and needs. 

It should support different types of assessment from self-assessments to formal appraisals or even audits. 

The COBIT Performance Management model largely aligns to and extends the Capability Maturity Model Integration, or CMMI Development 2.0 concepts. 

It supports concepts and methods such as capability and maturity levels. 

These models are assessment tools for evaluating an organization's level of progress towards target goals. 

Both techniques have performance levels ranging from zero to five, where lower level's define entry-level behaviors and higher levels defined best practice behaviors. 

Organizations go from lower to higher levels as they become more capable or mature in the areas being assessed. 

Generally, these models start with an assessment that determines a current state sometimes called as is. The next part is to determine the to be or desired state. 

The result or outcome from this analysis will facilitate the identification of potential gaps to assist in determining where priorities should be. 

Generally, you can only progress in a linear fashion. Additionally, these models can be used for benchmarking as well as creating conditions for meaningful discussions on the steps required to obtain desired levels. 

The capability level is a measure of how well a process is implemented and how well it is performing. 

Process activities are associated at capability levels. This is included in the Governance and Management Objectives Guide in COBIT. 

Other governance and management component types, for example, organizational structures or information, may also have capability levels. 

The process within each governance and management objective can operate at various capability levels ranging from zero to five. 

COBIT defines maturity levels as a performance measure at the focus area level. 

A focus area is a collection of governance and management objectives and underlying components. Sometimes a higher level is required for expressing performance without the granularity applicable to individual process capability ratings. 

Maturity levels can be used for that purpose. 

A certain maturity level is achieved if all the processes contained in the focus area achieve that particular capability level. 

As with capability level ratings, maturity levels are also measured using a zero to five scale.
