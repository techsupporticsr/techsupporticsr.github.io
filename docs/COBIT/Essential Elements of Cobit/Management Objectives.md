# Management Objectives
========================





![img](/img/Cobit_Domains.png)
 
## The distinction between governance and management: Management objectives

Management objectives are grouped in 

## 4 domains, 

### 1. Align, Plan, and Organize (APO) 
### 2. Build, Acquire, and Implement (BAI) 
### 3. Deliver, Service, and Support (DSS)
### 4. Monitor, Evaluate, and Assess (MEA)


These are distinct from the governance domain and are aligned with 

1. plan, 
2. build, 
3. run, and 
4. monitor process practices and activities. 

### 1. Align, Plan, and Organize (APO),
 
addresses the overall organization, strategy, and supporting activities for information and technology. 

There are 14 management objectives in this domain. 

Think of these as planning objectives that focus on those areas that are critical to successful preparation and alignment between governance objectives and management actions. 

It is quite exhaustive, but as you look through these, you can most likely see several that your organization uses. These include APO01 through APO14 and include 

### APO01 Managed I&T Framework, 
### APO02 Strategy, 
### APO03 Enterprise Architecture, 
### APO04 Innovation
### APO05 Portfolio, 
### APO06 Budget and Costs, 
### APO07 Human Resources, 
### APO08 Relationships, 
### APO09 Service Agreements, 
### APO10 Vendors, 
### APO11 Quality, 
### APO12 Risk, 
### APO13 Security, and 
### APO14 Data. 


#### 2. Build, Acquire, and Implement (BAI)

treats the definition, acquisition, and implementation of information and technology solutions and their integration in business processes. 

Think of this as the build domain. 

I like to say that any time we are adding, removing, or changing something in the live environment, this domain identifies the areas that should be considered. 

There are 11 management objectives in this domain.  The objectives in this domain include BAI01 to BAI11 and include 

### BAI01 Managed Programs, 
### BAI02 Requirements Definition, 
### BAI03 Solutions Identification and Build, 
### BAI04 Availability and Capacity, 
### BAI05 Organizational Change, 
### BAI06 IT Changes, 
### BAI07 IT Change Acceptance and Transitioning, 
### BAI08 Knowledge, 
### BAI09 Assets, 
### BAI10 Configurations, and 
### BAI11 Projects. 


#### Deliver, Service, and Support (DSS)

addresses the operational delivery and support of information and technology services, including security. 

Consider this the run phase. 
Objectives required to daily operate and respond to actions can be found here. These span DSS01 to DSS06 and include 

### DSS01 Managed Operations, 
### DSS02 Service Requests and Incidents,
### DSS03 Problems, 
### DSS04 Continuity, 
### DSS05 Security Services, and 
### DSS06 Business Process Controls. 

#### Monitor, Evaluate, and Assess (MEA)

addresses performance monitoring and conformance of information and technology with internal performance targets, internal control objectives, and external requirements. 

Think of this as the monitor phase. 

There are four management objectives in this domain. These are MEA01 to MEA04 and they include 

### MEA01 Managed Performance and Conformance Monitoring, 
### MEA02 System of Internal Control, 
### MEA03 Compliance with External Requirements, and 
### MEA04 Managed Assurance.
