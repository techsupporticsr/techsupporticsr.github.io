# Addressing the ingredients of a governance system
========================





To satisfy governance and management objectives, each enterprise needs to establish, tailor, and sustain a governance system built from a number of components. 

Components are factors that individually and collectively contribute to the good operations of the enterprise's governance system over information and technology. 

I like to think of these components as ingredients to any IT governance system.
 
There are seven components of a governance system identified in the COBIT framework.

These include processes, organizational structures, information, people, skills, and competencies, principles, policies, and procedures, culture, ethics, and behavior, and services, infrastructure, and applications. 

These components interact with each other resulting in a holistic governance system. 

They can be of different types. Of course, the most familiar are processes. 

## 1. Processes 

describe an organized set of practices and activities to achieve certain objectives, and produce a set of outputs that support achievement of overall IT-related goals. Each process in COBIT relates to a governance or management objective. There are 40 of these. In COBIT, each process is described using a set of practices. Each of these practices are supported by a number of activities. 

## 2. Organizational 

structures are the key decision-making entities in an enterprise. The organizational structures governance component suggests levels of responsibility and accountability for process practices. COBIT links these organizational structures to each process through the use of a RACI chart. 

## 3. Information 

is pervasive throughout any organization and includes all information produced and used by the enterprise. COBIT focuses on information required for the effective functioning of the governance system of the enterprise. 

## 4. People, skills and competencies 

are required for good decisions, execution of corrective action, and successful completion of all activities.This component identifies human resources and skills required to achieve the governance or management objective. 

## 5. Principles, policies, and procedures 

translate desired behavior into practical guidance for day-to-day management. This component provides detailed guidance on policies and procedures that are relevant for the governance or management objective. 


## 6. Culture, ethics and behavior

, this component provides the detailed guidance on desired cultural elements within the organization that support the achievement of a governance or management objective. 


## 7. Services, infrastructure, and applications

include the infrastructure, technology and applications that provide the enterprise with a governance system for information and technology processing. This component provides detailed guidance on third-party services, types of infrastructure, and categories of applications that can be applied to support the achievement of a governance or management objective. 


As you can see these components make up the ingredients of your governance system. 

If you add or remove an ingredient, an appropriate amount should be considered for the other ingredients. 

For example, if you change an organizational policy, you should also consider any changes to other components such as processes, information, culture, and so on. Later in this course, I'll show you how each of these components, or ingredients, are linked to the governance and management objectives in COBIT.
