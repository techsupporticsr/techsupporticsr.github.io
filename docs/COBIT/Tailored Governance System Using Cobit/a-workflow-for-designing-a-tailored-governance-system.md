# A workflow for designing a tailored governance system
========================





![img](/img/Cobit_Design_Workflow.png)

The different stages and steps in the design process will result in recommendations for prioritizing governance and management objectives, related governance system components, or target capability levels. 

This workflow includes: 

### Step 1 - understand the enterprise context and strategy. 

### Step 2 - determine the initial scope of the governance system. 

### Step 3 - refine the scope of the governance system. 

### Step 4 - conclude the governance system design. 

In step 1, understand the enterprise context and strategy, this is where the enterprise will gather information and understand the first four design factors. 

Those are enterprise strategy, enterprise goals, risk profile, and IT-related issues. 

In step 2, determine the initial scope of the governance system, the enterprise then considers the first four design factors and assigns values appropriate to the enterprise's posture. 

The possible values for each of these are identified in COBIT, as well as mapping tables that illustrate the connection strength between the design factor value and the applicable governance and management objectives. 

Although this step will provide an initial governance system, it is highly suggested to continue with the remaining steps. 

In step 3, refine the scope of the governance system, the remainder of the design factors are analyzed. 

These steps include considering the following remaining design factors: threat landscape, compliance requirements, role of IT, sourcing model for IT, IT implementation methods, technology adoption strategy, and finally enterprise size. 

As with step two, a set of potential values are available for each of these factors, and mapping tables in COBIT provide a connection strength between the selected values and the appropriate governance and management objectives. 

In step 4, conclude the governance system design where any conflicts in priorities are identified and adjustments made to the governance priorities. 

It is recommended to put all guidance obtained during the different steps on a design canvas. And in the last stage of the design process, resolve to the degree possible the conflicts among any elements on the design canvas and conclude. 

When resolving inherit priority conflicts, it's not unusual to have a difference between the results of the design process and other factors that might require different priorities or target capability levels. For example, you may have a legal or regulatory requirement that requires a certain process or domain to be at a high level, let's say capability level four, or management may disagree with the importance or target capability level and suggest that the targets be changed due to business reasons that were not considered in the analysis.

These conflicts may be resolved by increasing or decreasing the importance levels of those areas if all stakeholders agree. 

The final design will be a case-by-case decision based on all the elements on this design canvas. 

The governance system design is concluded once all conflicts have been addressed and key stakeholders agree with the design. 

By following these steps, enterprises will realize a governance system that is tailored to their needs. I get many questions about how often this should be completed. Well, there's no specific guidance on this, but in organizations I see today using this approach, most of them are doing this annually as a part of their normal strategy planning activities. 

They will update this on a periodic basis, say quarterly, and make modifications as internal or external factors require changes to the governance system design.
