# Impact of design factors
========================





![img](/img/Cobit_Impact_of_Design_Factors.png)

 The design factors can individually or collectively create the governance system that supports the needs of the enterprise and can influence the tailoring of the governance system in many ways. 

Based on an enterprise's posture and the design factors, there are three different impacts they can have that can assist in a tailored governance system. 

### 1. Management objective priority and target capability levels 

### 2. Component variations

### 3. Specific focus areas

### For 1. Management Objective Priority and Target Capability Levels. 

Design factors can help determine the importance level of the governance and management objectives. 

A tailored governance system may not need to focus on all objectives, just the ones that have the most meaningful impact to enterprise goal achievement, and therefore meeting stakeholder needs. For example, an enterprise operating in a high threat environment may have more emphasis on the risk and security related objectives. 

This not only places a higher priority on the most relevant governance and management objectives, but can also provide a basis for target capability levels required. 

The processes associated with each governance and management objective can operate at various capability levels ranging from zero to five. It would be a waste of valuable resources to apply effort to attain a capability level four on a process, or level two would be sufficient in the tailored governance system. 

### For 2. component variations, 

there are seven governance components identified in the COBIT framework, and these are required to achieve governance and management objectives. 

These are what I call the ingredients to a governance system. 

Some design factors can influence the importance of one or more of these components or can require specific variations. For example, an enterprise that operates in a highly regulated environment will attribute more importance to documented information or work products, certain policies and procedures and to some organizational roles such as the compliance officer function. 


### For 3. specific focus areas, 

some design factors will drive the need for variation of the core COBIT model content to a specific context. 

A focus area describes a certain governance topic, domain or issue that can be addressed by a collection of specific governance and management objectives and their components. 

Some design factors such as threat landscape, a specific risk, target development methods and infrastructure setup will drive the need for variation of the core COBIT model content to a specific context. An example of this would be an enterprise adopting a DevOps approach. 

Will require a governance system that has a variant of several generic COBIT processes described in the DevOps focus area guidance for COBIT. 

The number of focus areas is virtually unlimited. 

They can include small and medium sized enterprises, cybersecurity, risk, cloud computing, privacy and DevOps as examples. 

This is what makes COBIT open ended. New focus areas can be added as required, or as subject matter experts and practitioners contribute to this body of knowledge.
