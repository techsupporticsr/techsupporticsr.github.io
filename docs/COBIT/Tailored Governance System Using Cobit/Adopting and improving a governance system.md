# Adopting and improving a governance system
========================


The COBIT 2019 implementation guide emphasizes in enterprise-wide view of governance of information and technology.

Therefore it should be implemented as an integral part of enterprise governance, covering the full end to end business and IT functional areas of responsibility. 

The implementation approach is based on empowering business and IT stakeholders and role players to take ownership of IT related governance and management decisions and activities by facilitating and enabling change. 

The COBIT implementation lifecycle approach allows enterprises to address the complexity and challenges typically encountered during implementations. 

There are three interrelated components to the implementation life cycle. 

These include the core enterprise governance of information and technology 

### Continual Improvement life cycle - inner ring, 

### Change Enablement-  middle ring 

that addresses behavioral and cultural aspects of implementation or improvement. 

### Program Management - the outer ring. 

The methodology is a continuous life cycle that emphasizes in ongoing process of implementation and improvement that ultimately becomes business as usual. 

The life cycle has 7 phases, 

high level health checks, assessments and audits often trigger an initiative and the results can become input to the first phase. 
During the last phase, the objectives and requirements often surface in a new iteration may begin. 

The phases of the life cycle include:

### Phase 1 - what are the drivers? 

This identifies current change drivers and creates at executive management levels. A desire to change that is then expressed in an outline of a business case. 

### Phase 2 - where a we now? 

This aligns information and technology related objectives with enterprise strategies and risks and prioritizes the most important enterprise goals, alignment goals and processes.

### Phase 3 - where do we want to be? 

This sets targets for improvement followed by a gap analysis to identify potential solutions.

### Phase 4 - what needs to be done? 

This describes how to plan feasible and practical solutions by defining project supported by justifiable business cases and a changed plan for implementation. 

### Phase 5 - how do we get there? 

This provides for implementing the proposed solutions and establishing measures to ensure that the business alignment is achieved and performance can be measured. 

### Phase 6 - did we get there? 

This focuses on sustainable transition of the improved governance and management practices into normal business operations. 

### Phase 7 - how do we keep the momentum going? 

This reviews, the overall success of the initiative, identifies further governance or management requirements and reinforces the need for continual improvement. 


The implementation program is closed when the process for focusing on IT related priorities in governance improvement is generating a measurable benefit and the program has become embedded into ongoing business activity. 

These phases are further described in the implementation guide. And one of the things I really like about this guide is that it addresses challenges, success factors, roles, tasks, inputs and outputs for each of the phases. 

The implementation lifecycle described here is intended to work in conjunction with the governance design workflow. You may recall that the design workflow has four steps while this implementation lifecycle has seven phases. 

The design steps essentially elaborates a set of tasks defined in the implementation model. 

There are three phases of the implementation guide that are influenced or enhanced by this guide.

Why only the first three phases? 

This is because these are the most appropriate for the design of a governance system. And these include 

** 1. phase 1 of the implementation guide.** What are the drivers? This is aligned with the COBIT design guide step one, understand enterprise context and strategy.

** 2. phase 2 of the implementation guide,** where are we now? This is aligned with steps two, three and four of the COBIT design guide and 

** 3. phase 3 of the implementation guide,** where do we want to be is aligned with step four of the COBIT design guide. This is valuable because when an enterprise is embarking on an implementation effort, the first three phases can be augmented with the design workflow to ensure that a tailored solution is being adopted.
