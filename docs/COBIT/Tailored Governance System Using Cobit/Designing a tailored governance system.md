# Designing a tailored governance system
========================







Governance over a complex matter like information and technology requires a multitude of components and all of these need to work together in a systematic way. 

There is no single copy and paste governance system for enterprise information and technology that fits everyone. 

Each enterprise is distinct in many various aspects. Therefore they should tailor their governance system to gain the most value out of their use of information technology. 

From the COBIT perspective, tailoring means that an enterprise starts from the COBIT core model and applies changes to this generic framework based on the relevance and importance of a series of design factors and the use of focus areas. 

This process is called designing the governance system for enterprise information and technology.

Design factors influence the tailoring of the governance system of an enterprise. 

Think of these as key points or areas that can assist in creating a model that truly aligns with specific and unique enterprise needs. 

COBIT uses these design factors to determine which governance and management objectives are the most valuable, influential, and relevant to an organization's posture.
 
The design guide includes tables that map the relevance of each of these factors to the appropriate objectives, therefore creating a customized approach to specific objectives that are unique to an enterprise's specific needs. 

Enterprises have different strategies, which can be expressed in many ways. 

These could be a focus on growth and acquisition, innovation and differentiation, cost leadership and client service stability. 

Organizations typically have a primary strategy and at most one secondary strategy, for example, an enterprise focusing on innovation and differentiation what's the objective such as innovation, portfolio and knowledge. 

Enterprise strategy is realized by the achievement of a set of enterprise goals. 

These goals are defined in the COBIT framework and it's called the goals cascade. For example, if an enterprise chose compliance with extra laws and regulations as a key enterprise goal and objectives such as risk, security, internal control compliance, and assurance would be appropriate.

The risk profile identifies the information and technology related risks to which the enterprise is currently exposed and indicates which areas of risk are exceeding the risk appetite. COBIT provides a set of high level risk scenarios that can be used as a start. 

Each of these scenarios can be assessed using likelihood and impact, which will in turn identify the most appropriate objectives. For example, if an enterprise determined that a key risk scenario, was IT operational and infrastructure incidents, then the most appropriate objectives might include most of the objectives in the BAI or build acquire and implement domain and all of the objectives in DSS or Deliver Service and Support. 

The enterprise should consider which information and technology related issues it currently faces. Or in other words, what I and T related risk has materialized. COBIT provides a set of typical issues or what I call pain points that might be encountered in an organization. Say an organization determines that the excessively high cost of IT is an issue that budget and costs, assets and resources would be the most applicable objectives to focus on.
 
The threat landscape indicates the environment in which the enterprise operates with regard to external threats. 

Is the enterprise operating under what are considered normal threat levels or due to its geopolitical situation, industry sector or particular profile is the enterprise operating in a high threat environment? For example, if an organization considers its threat landscape as high, then objectives regarding risk, security, and assurance would be determined as critical. 

This looks at the compliance requirements to which the enterprise is subjected to. 

Is the enterprise subject to a minimal, regular or higher than average set of compliance requirements? Let's use the example of an international banking system that focuses on high value clients. They might consider themselves in a higher than average compliance position, and therefore would likely see objectives from the EDM or Evaluate Direct and Monitor and MEA or Monitor, Evaluate, and Assess domains as critical. 

The role of IT varies in every organization. There is a wide range of possibilities here. 

Is IT considered a support structure, a critical success factor for turnaround or innovation or somewhere in between? For example, if the IT organization is viewed as a strategic enabler to the success of the enterprise, then objectives such as governance in IT frameworks, innovation and portfolio would be key. 

Enterprises have a multitude of sourcing options, and each of them has a different impact on the design of the governance system. 

Enterprises can outsource processes, use cloud services, insource or a combination of all three, let's say a startup company focuses exclusively on cloud services. 

In this case objectives focused on risk, service agreements, relationships and vendors would be appropriate. 

COBIT recognizes that there are many modes of delivery and IT implementation methods. 

These can include a traditional approach, which is often called waterfall, an Agile approach or a continuous deployment method known as DevOps, or they can be a combination of all three. A company that exclusively uses DevOps as their continuous deployment style would likely see the most important objectives as enterprise architecture, risk, solutions identification and build, change, acceptance, and transitioning and managed operations. 

Enterprises have varying strategies in their technology adoptions. Does the organization generally adopt new technologies as early as possible? Do they wait for new technologies to become mainstream before adopting them, or do they adopt technology very late? If a technology startup company considers itself a first mover with regards to technology adoption, then objectives such as enterprise architecture, human resources, relationships, and solutions, identification, and build might be the most appropriate objectives to focus on. 

COBIT identifies two categories of enterprise size. 

These are essentially small and medium sized enterprises and large enterprises. This is not necessarily a significant factor as any size of organization can tailor their governance system based on the factors we've discussed up to this point, however, governance system implementations can be drastically affected by resource constraints. The list of the design factors is not absolute. 

Enterprises can add, remove or modify any of these factors to allow for their own customized governance system. 

Additionally, as our business landscape changes in the future, there may be additional design factors added to this model, as other variables are discovered that are appropriate. 

Use these design factors to meet your specific needs. The challenge lies in your ability to identify and agree on your specific values for each of these factors.
