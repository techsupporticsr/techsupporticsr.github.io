# Design a tailored system using design factors
========================





![img](/img/Cobit_Impact_of_Design_Factors.png)

Designing a tailored governance system sounds easy, but it can be harder than you think. Let's dig into the details of how you do this. 

How do I determine an appropriate governance system for my enterprise, considering my unique environment? 

In COBIT we're going to turn to the [Design Guide](/files/COBIT_2019_Design_Guide.pdf) for this. The Design Guide introduces factors and focus areas and includes a design workflow that facilitates the creation of a tailored governance system.
 
This publication is the first of its kind and has a wealth of information and even examples regarding a customized and tailorable governance system in any organization. It also emphasizes the relationship between this governance system design and the actual implementation of this governance system, which is captured in the Implementation Guide. COBIT uses design factors to determine which governance and management objectives are the most valuable, influential, and relevant to an organization's unique posture. These factors are a key part of the governance system design workflow, which proposes a method for designing a tailored governance system. Both the design factors and the design workflow are covered earlier in this course. One of the things I really like is the mapping tables that provide a reference to which governance and management objectives are most appropriate for governance systems based on the design factors. So let's take a look. The COBIT 2019 introduction and methodology publication will introduce you to design factors, focus areas, and the design workflow discussed in this course. Let's see what this guidance looks like. Section 2.6 of this guide identifies and describes the design factors and the range of attributes that each enterprise can choose from. These are the key inputs into the tailored governance system for an enterprise. For example, we see here, the first design factor, enterprise strategy. An enterprise's strategy is expressed as one or more of these archetypes. If you scroll through the design factors, you can see that each one has a unique set of inputs for each one of the design factors. Here's the great part. If we jump to appendix a, you'll see a series of mapping tables. COBIT takes each one of the design factors and provides a connection between your specific attributes to each of the design factors and the relevant governance or management objective. Earlier, we looked at the first design factor enterprise strategies. As you see here, we have the four strategy archetypes. Growth and acquisition, innovation and differentiation, cost leadership, and client service and stability. Based on your organization's strategy focus, this table indicates which objective creates the most value for you. The mappings use a scale from zero to four. Four indicating the most influence and zero indicating the absence of any relationship. If it sounds like a lot of work to manually go through this guide and determine which are the most appropriate governance and management objectives, you're not alone. Wait till you see what's next. ISACA has also created an Excel tool that can do this for you. This Design Guide toolkit is an Excel tool kit that can be found on the ISACA website. I know it looks very busy, but let's zoom in on the top and see what the top areas look like. Across the top you'll see each of the steps and the design factors. Notice here in column B4, you see Enterprise Strategy, next to that Enterprise Goals, you have Risk Profile, I&T Related Issues. And those first four create our initial design. After that, we look at the Threat Landscape, Compliance Requirements, Role of IT, Sourcing Model for IT, IT Implementation Methods, and Technology Adoption Strategy. Down the left hand side, you see our governance and management objectives. You'll see it starts all the way at the end top at EDM 01. And if you scroll down, it goes through all 40 of the governance and management objectives that we have in the COBIT core. This is what we call the canvas, we'll come back and take a look at this in just a few minutes. But if you look at the bottom of the spreadsheet, you'll notice the green tabs are labeled DF1 through DF10. Those are the design factors. Let's take a look at the first design factor, that's DF1. This design factor is what we call enterprise strategy. Remember we said in design factor one, Enterprise Strategy, there are four potential archetypes we could have. Growth and acquisition, innovation and differentiation, cost leadership, and client service stability. What we have to do now as an organization is determine the relevance or the importance levels for our organization. Now you can go in here and put fives on each one of those, but if you did that, the relative importance of the governance and management objectives would basically be the same. So we have to have priorities in here. So in an organization I was in, the board of directors made it very clear. Grow, grow, grow, and digitally transform. So this is an example of this organization. You'll see here, we have five for growth and acquisition. That was my board's number one concern. Following that they said digital transformation and innovation, that was a four. And therefore, we have cost leadership, client service stability as one. Now here's what's really neat. There are several ways in which COBIT identifies the governance and management objectives that are most appropriate. If I go down to this table here, this is incredible. What you'll see here on the left hand side, it takes each one of those governance and management objectives and tells me the relative importance of each one of those objectives based on my answers in just this design factor. You notice down the center, we see zero. If it goes to the left of zero, it doesn't mean it's negative value. It basically means if I'm assigning resources to those objectives, I'm probably misappropriating those resources. If it goes to the right of zero, that means we have really found that objective that's really creating value for the enterprise, which is really, really nice tool for us to have. There are several other ways that we can view the importance of each one of those governance and management objectives in here. What we'll do in this toolkit down below, you'll go to design factor number two next. In design factor number two, this is what we call enterprise goals. Remember we saw in this course that we have 13 enterprise goals. What we do is give them a general level of importance and we see the same thing down below. It will give us each one of the governance and management objectives and their relative importance based on our input. What you do in this tool is go through each one of those design factors and determine which of the attributes are the most important for your organization. And when you finish, that takes you back out to this canvas. Let me zoom out so you can see what this canvas looks like. And we'll zoom in on a couple of areas that are most important for us. If I look at this canvas, you'll notice of course, across the top, we have each one of our design factors. Down the left hand side, we see the governance and management objectives. In the table you see the inputs for each one of those design factors. And then to the right in column Q, what we'll see is the overall refined scope that tells us the general importance of each one of those design factors based on the input values for every one of those design factors. Folks, what you see here is a tailored governance system based on your inputs. Therefore, if anyone of your design factors changes, the relative importance of those governance and management objectives may change as well. You also have adjustments for any conflicts that you may have. And once you do those adjustments, notice to the right based on your input in columns W and X, you will see a target capability level for that specific objective. And therefore that process. We covered this very quickly, but do yourself a favor, go out to the ISACA site, go to the COBIT section under the Design Guide, download the Design Guide toolkit. This will offer you an Excel spreadsheet that does the calculations for you, so you don't have to go use the tables in the back of the Design Guide. Can you use those tables? Absolutely. You can. You can do that to adjust any of your priority levels and resolve any conflicts that you might have. 

This is the Design Guide toolkit. It can be found on the ISACA website. N

ow enterprises have the capability to not only create a tailored governance system based on their design factors, but as conditions change, the governance system can also quickly adapt to those changes.
