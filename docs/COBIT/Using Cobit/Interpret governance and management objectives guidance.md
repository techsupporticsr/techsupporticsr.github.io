# Interpret governance and management objectives guidance

========================





![img](/img/Cobit_Impact_of_Design_Factors.png)

 For information and technology to contribute to enterprise goals, a number of governance and management objectives must be achieved. Here are the governance and management objectives organizing the five domains, one governance domain and four management domains. In the governance and management objectives publication, each of these objectives is described in great detail in the following ways, high level information, goals cascade information, related components, and related guidance. Let's say you have either completed a tailored governance system analysis using the design factors or have simply done a goals cascade and determined that several of these objectives are key to value creation. Let's pick an objective, DSS03-managed problems. What guidance does this COBIT provide on this management objective? Let's take a look. To find this we go to the COBIT governance and management objectives publication. This has the detailed guidance on all of the governance and management objectives in the framework. Since we are looking at DSS03-managed problems, we'll go to that section of the publication. What we see here is the COBIT guidance on this particular management objective. You'll see at the top is the domain deliver services support, and the management objective DSS03. There's a description statement and it's purpose statement. But what I really like is the next piece that shows us the enterprise goals and alignment goals mapping. It gives us the enterprise goals and the alignment goals that this particular management objective maps to, and it also gives us some metrics to help us track our ability to meet those goals. You might remember that we had seven governance components. The first of those components is process. If you take a look at here, we say A, component process. In that component, we have several management practices and each of those practices is broken up into activities. This particular objective has multiple practices. This is the first practice as you see here, we see DSS03.01. That's the first practice in this objective. For you auditors, you might recognize these as control objectives. We also see example metrics and the activities. Notice over on the right-hand side, it has a capability level. This capability level is a capability that is assigned to that specific activity in order to meet that particular capability level. At the bottom of this practice, you see related guidance. Related guidance we have for DSS03.01 is ISO 20,000, and it gives us a detailed reference there as well. To move down, we have the second practice, DSS03.02. We have example metrics, activities, and the suggested capability levels for those activities. In this case, we have no related guidance for DSS03.02. DSS03.03, we see the description, we see the example metrics, activities, and the suggested capability levels as well as no related guidance for this specific practice. DSS03.04, a description example metrics, activities, capability levels, and no related guidance for this one. DSS03.05, example metrics, activities, capability levels, and we do have some related guidance here, which is CMMI and ITIL version three. Notice here it says, ITIL version three. Even though I tell is on version four, the mapping between version three and version four with the processes versus the practices is not that difficult. Next we have the next component, which is organizational structures. What we'll see here is each of those five practices we just saw, and on the right, we see specific roles that are allocated to this objective. Notice that in this RACI chart, we only identify responsible and accountable. Accountable being who owns the practice, responsible being who does the practice. We don't have consulted and informed because every organization is different and you can determine which of the roles in your organization are consultant informed based on your organizational structures and your culture in your organization. At the bottom of this organizational structures practice, we see related guidance, and there's no related guidance here. The next component is information flows and items. You will love this. For each one of the practices, COBIT identifies the inputs and outputs for each of the practices of this process. The next component, people skills and competencies. What COBIT does is identifies the appropriate skills and competencies, identifies the related guidance and the detailed references for those. We have the policies or procedures component where we have relevant policies, the description of that policy, any related guidance, and detailed references for that. Culture, ethics and behavior. Key cultural elements if there was related guidance or detailed reverence that would be doted here. And finally, the last component, services, infrastructure and applications, which identifies any tools, applications, services that might be able to add to this particular objective. And in this case, a problem tracking and resolution system. We just looked at the COBIT guidance for DSS03-managed problems. The same type of guidance is provided for each of the 40 governance and management objectives. Wow, what can you do with this information? First, understand the description and the purpose of each of the objectives that are in the 40 governance and management objectives guide. Appreciate how that objective is associated with the goals cascade or the applicable alignment and enterprise goals in COBIT. Associate each of the governance and management objectives to the seven governance components that we just saw. Gain valuable information on what additional industry practices, standards, frameworks, and bodies of knowledge are applicable to the objective. The best part is this, the guidance offer some very practical advice to help assemble all the things you need to do to create Actionable and repeatable practices and activities to support value creation to your enterprise.
