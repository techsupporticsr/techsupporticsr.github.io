# Use the goals cascade to ensure alignment

========================




Many organizations struggle with the idea of aligning their IT strategy with the overall enterprise strategy.

One solution to this is the goals cascade.

It is a generic tool that can take an enterprise's specific stakeholder needs and drivers and associate these with the various goals identified in the COBIT framework, ultimately identifying the most influential governance and management objectives, and therefore, which processes should be addressed. 

Information on the goals cascade comes primarily from two COBIT publications, the Introduction and Methodology that offers a high-level view and description of the cascade and the Governance and Management Objectives guide that illustrates the various mapping tables that puts this cascade into actionable results. 

Let's start with the Introduction and Methodology first. 

The COBIT 2019 Introduction and Methodology publication will introduce you to the goals cascade and provide foundational information about its use and value. 

This publication can be found on the ISACA website. In this section, I will walk you through the basic tables that identify the various goals and objectives in this model. Following this, I'll show you how they are connected to each other. 

If you go to section 4.6 of this publication, you will find the introduction of this model. 

There is a flow of the cascade here, which starts with stakeholder drivers and needs.
 
These cascade to enterprise goals, which cascade to alignment goals, which finally cascade to governance and management objectives. 

Next, we see a table of the enterprise goals. 

There are 13 of these goals, and they are labeled EG01 to EG13, with a title of the goal, which balanced scorecard dimension each goal supports, and finally, some example metrics. 

These metrics can be used to measure your ability to meet or support each enterprise goal. 

You can add, remove, or modify any of these goals to meet your specific needs. 

As I scroll through these goals, you can see the full breadth of the areas they cover. 

Now, after the enterprise goals, we will see alignment goals next. Alignment goals were known as IT-related goals in previous versions of COBIT. 

Today, they are alignment goals because they basically align the enterprise goals with the governance and management objectives that should be considered when governing and managing enterprise information and technology. 

As with enterprise goals, there are 13 alignment goals labeled AG01 to AG13. 

This alignment goal table has a title of each goal, which balanced scorecard dimension each goal supports, and finally, some example metrics. 

Finally, we see the governance and management objectives. 

These objectives are illustrated in the COBIT core model, which I referred to as the box of boxes that identified all of the 40 objectives in five domains. 

As you see here, each of the objectives are identified with their name and purpose statement. 

Here are the EDMs, APOs, BAIs, DSS, and finally, MEA. Now let's take a look at what the governance and management objectives publication tells us about the goals cascade. The governance and management objectives publication includes 40 governance and management objectives organized into five domains. 

Each objective is related to one process, and guidance related to each of the governance components is included. 

In terms of the COBIT goals cascade, this publication is a valuable reference. 

It provides the mapping tables between the key goals tables we just walked through. I think you will like what you're about to see. 

If you go to Appendix A of this guide, you'll find a series of mapping tables that connect the enterprise and alignment goals to the governance of management objectives. Here we see the mapping table between enterprise and alignment goals. Let's start at the top. 

![img](/img/Cobit_Enterprise_Goals2.png)

These are the 13 enterprise goals that we saw in the introduction and methodology publication. On the left hand side, we see the 13 alignment goals. 

These are the goals we saw in the table from the introduction of methodology publication, as well. Now, look at this. 

The table makes a connection between these alignment goals and the enterprise goals using primary and secondary relationships.
 
We see these here indicated with a P or an S. A primary relationship indicates the alignment goal directly supports the higher goal. 

If the alignment goal is not met, then the enterprise goal is at risk of not being met, as well. 

A secondary relationship indicates that there is a connection between the goals, but it's not necessarily a show stopper. 

For example, let's say that based on your stakeholder needs and drivers, you indicate that EG03 compliance with external laws and regulations is a high-priority enterprise goal. This mapping tells you that there are two primary relationships, AG01 and AG11.
 
There's also a secondary relationship, which is AG13. Therefore, these are the alignment goals that should be considered priorities. 

Next, let's see how these alignment goals map to the governance and management objectives. 

This table shows the mapping between the alignment goals and the governance and management objectives. 

Here we see the alignment goals now on the top of the table, and down the left hand side, we see the 40 governance and management objectives. 

Like we saw in the previous mapping, these are connected through primary and secondary relationships. 

As we saw in the last table, we identified two primary alignment goals and one secondary goal that are important to us. 

Now, let's see how those high priority alignment goals map into the governance of management objectives. For the purposes of this demonstration, I'll focus only on the primary relationships. First, we had AG01 on the top of this table. 

We see that AG01 has a primary relationship with EDM01, ensured governance framework setting and maintenance, and MEA04, managed assurance. 

And we also identified AG11 as a critical alignment goal. We see here that AG11 has a primary relationship with APO01, managed IT management framework. 

And if I scroll down, MEA02, managed compliance with external requirements, and MEA04, managed assurance. 

How does this goals cascade help you in your organization? As we just saw, this offers a tool that can take your specific and unique stakeholder needs and drivers and map those into a series of goals that ultimately indicate which of the 40 governance and management objectives are the most relevant to focus on. This allows for the proper allocation of resources and funding to the objectives that are aligned to the most value contribution. 

This goals cascade is just one of the design factors that can assist in creating a tailored governance system. You can focus solely on this goals cascade, or you can use this as one of the several design factors available. 

Many people look at these mapping tables and assume that this is a rigid and inflexible approach. Not correct. 

Remember, you can map your specific organizational goals into this model, change the goals to fit your needs, or even add weightings to different goals that can focus on what your enterprise thinks is important. Don't stop there. You can also map these alignment goals to many other governance components. 

We just saw the mapping tables that map to governance and management objectives. And remember, each of these aligns to a process. However, processes are just one of seven components. 

You can also map to policies, organizational structures, culture, information services, and people. 

COBIT doesn't provide these mapping tables because they vary widely based on your specific information and your organizational needs.
