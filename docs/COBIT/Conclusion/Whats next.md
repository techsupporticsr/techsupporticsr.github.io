# What's next?
========================


In this course, you learn about how the latest release of the COBIT framework enables a tailored approach to creating a governance and management framework over enterprise information and technology. 

One of the key points that I would like for you to take away from this course, gain an understanding of the drivers for adopting a governance program. 

Why are you looking into governance systems for your enterprise? 

Is it due to a major trigger event or a pain point? Assemble the right stakeholders and verify their support. 

Educate those stakeholders on enterprise governance over information technology. And finally, of course, COBIT has an enterprise flavor to it, but it can be used in your local environment as well. 

I have so many people say to me, "this is great stuff, "but I'm trying to adopt a governance system "and my executives are not listening." I have a great solution for you. Implement COBIT within the four walls that you have influence in.

What I mean is this, imagine your group, section, division, or organization is a business. 

Do a tailored governance system for your area of interest.

You might find that your governance and management practices start finding themselves working throughout the entire organization.
