# Using COBIT as an IT governance framework
========================



There are many standards, frameworks, bodies of knowledge, methodologies, and best practices in the information and technology industry. 

It is very difficult to know what these are, how they can be used, and what value they can provide to your organization. 

The problem that most of us run into is knowing which ones are the most appropriate for our organizations and how we pick what creates the most value. 

You're in luck because I often refer to COBIT as the framework to manage frameworks. And I'll show you why throughout this course. 

Not only this COBIT offer a solution to framework overload, it focuses on value creation by meeting stakeholder needs through recognizing benefits while optimizing risks and resources. 

The distinction between governance and management is an often misunderstood concept. 

Every organization has multiple governing bodies throughout the organization, and their charter should be distinct from the management team who is implementing their guidance. How would you describe the difference between governance and management in your organization? 

Governance ensures stakeholder needs, conditions, and options are evaluated to determine balanced, agreed-on enterprise objectives.
 
Direction is set through prioritization and decision making and performance and compliance are monitored against agreed-on direction and objectives.

In most enterprises overall governance is the responsibility of the board of directors under the leadership of the chairperson. 

Specific governance responsibilities may be delegated to special organizational structures at an appropriate level, particularly in larger, more complex enterprises. 

Management will plan build, run, and monitor activities in alignment with the direction set by the governing body to achieve the enterprise objectives. 

In most enterprises management is the responsibility of executive management under the leadership of a chief executive officer. 

I often get questions about where COBIT actually fits in the context of an enterprise's governance system. And here's my answer. 

If you break governance down into what I call altitudes, there are three levels that help describe how COBIT fits into the ecosystem of frameworks. 

My three levels are: enterprise governance, governance of enterprise information and technology and frameworks, standards, and good practices. 

Let's start at the top, enterprise governance. This is an altitude that is a chief concern of most governing bodies. 

How do you effectively balance performance and conformance? As you may know, organizations can not be fully compliant to every single conformance requirement without affecting business performance. Let's take a look at what I mean here. On the left, we see performance.
 
The goal is to meet enterprise performance requirements. And many of you might recognize the balanced scorecard, or BSC, as a tool to record and report that performance. Balanced with performance is conformance. 

In today's highly compliant environment we all need to ensure that we are meeting our legal and regulatory requirements, such as GDPR, Sarbanes-Oxley, and many others.

For now let's skip the middle altitude that I call governance of enterprise information and technology because most organizations miss this part. We'll come back to that in a minute. At the bottom, we see my third altitude frameworks, standards, and good practices. 

This is where we see framework fatigue. I see many enterprises jump directly from enterprise governance to frameworks without any consideration for how information and technology is governed. 

We have so many solutions available today that we think are the silver bullet. 

This is going to save us, but it's not wise to fully adopt all of these blindly. 

We have ITIL, multiple ISO and NIST standards, bodies of knowledge such as PIMBOK and TOGAF and other relevant regulations that distract us. 

The key is to know which parts are the most appropriate and applicable and add value to our enterprise. 

This is where COBIT provides the most value. Think of it as middleware between the enterprise governance and your frameworks. 

As I mentioned earlier, COBIT could be a framework to manage your frameworks and I'll teach you this during the course.
