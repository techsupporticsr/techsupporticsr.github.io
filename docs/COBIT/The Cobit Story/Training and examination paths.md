# Training and examination paths
========================


There are three paths defined in the COBIT certification scheme. The first path is the 2019 Bridge course, which is intended to transition current COBIT 5 accredited training organizations and trainers or COBIT 5 certificate holders seeking to understand the key differences between COBIT 2019 and COBIT 5. The second path, COBIT 2019 Foundation course and exam is intended for those new to COBIT or those who wish to gain deeper understanding of the COBIT 2019 framework and or prepare for the COBIT 2019 Foundation exam. We'll talk more about this later in this course. The third path is the COBIT 2019 design and implementation course, which is designed to help learners understand how to design and implement a governance system using COBIT 2019. Prior to taking the COBIT 2019 design and implementation certification exam, candidates must first successfully pass the foundation course. The exam will test your understanding of these topics. And if you get a passing score on the foundation exam, you'll receive the COBIT 2019 Foundation Certificate. The exam covers eight key areas. They include the framework introduction, principles, governance system and components, governance and management objectives, performance management, designing a tailored governance system, business case, and implementation. The COBIT 2019 Foundation certificate exam is an online, closed book, remotely proctored exam. The exam covers the eight domains we discussed previously, and includes a total of 75 questions. Exam takers will be given two hours or 120 minutes to complete the exam. A score of 65% or higher is required to pass the exam. To purchase and schedule your exam, go to the ISACA website at isaca.org. 

I suggest that you also download the exam guide from this site before scheduling and taking this exam. It's a free download that explains the entire process for you.
