# Avoiding framework overload
========================



Most professional practices have frameworks, bodies of knowledge, and models to help them apply industry best practices. However, you should recognize that COBIT is not designed to work by itself. It's best applied when synchronized with some of the most relevant models in our industry. Have you ever been completely overwhelmed with all of the frameworks out there? 

When I was in charge of an IT infrastructure and operations team for a North American manufacturer, I was tasked with completely redesigning the IT department, which included technology, organizational structures, and processes.One of our consultants handed me a set of CDs. On those CDs was version two of the ITIL framework. This was great because I now had a framework that helped me organize my department by services, as well as designing the processes needed to support those services. I loved this framework, but it only focused on one area of my organization. I needed more guidance in other areas. 

This is when I ran into an alphabet maze of standards, frameworks, and best practices that all were supposed to save me. 

As luck would have it, my program management organization introduced a few great frameworks as well. 

These included the PMBOK, PRINCE2, and BABOK. It gets better. 

The board of directors mandated something called COSO. My architecture team recommended TOGAF. 

The information security team used multiple ISO and NIST standards. 

My quality team introduced CMMI, and HR recommended that I use something called SFIA. 

Then COBIT entered the picture, and things changed for us. 

We were going through an audit by our public accounting firm, and the auditor started asking us for evidence for several processes, few of which we had evidence for. 

When I asked the auditor where was this all coming from, she replied, "Well, of course this is coming from COBIT. 

You've never heard of it?" 

Great, another framework to keep track of. 

But this was different. 

Our company found that not only did COBIT identify the practices and activities that we should be focusing on, it also linked each of the processes to other frameworks, many of which were frameworks we were already using. 

This is when we decided that COBIT would be our framework to govern and manage our frameworks. 

From this perspective, think of it as middleware.

Middleware connect systems that don't inherently talk to each other, so it translates between them. 

This is exactly what COBIT did for us. 

It became our middleware between frameworks. 

One of the guiding principles applied throughout the development of COBIT was to maintain the positioning of COBIT as an umbrella framework. 

This means that COBIT continues to align with a number of relevant standards, frameworks, and regulations. 

COBIT does not contradict any guidance in these related standards. COBIT does not copy the contents of these related standards. 

But COBIT provides equivalent statements or references to related guidance. 

There are several industry frameworks that COBIT aligns with. 

A few of the most notable references and my favorites include t

he U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST standards, 
"A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge," or PMBOK, 
multiple ISO standards, 
and of course ITIL. 

Do you recognize any of these in your company? 

Are there any frameworks you use that are not here? 

Well, there are many more. 

COBIT aligns with some of the technology industry's most relevant and applicable models, most of which you are likely using today in your organization. 

I'll show you how COBIT as an umbrella framework can be your framework to manage frameworks like I did for my organization. 

You don't have to fully adopt every framework out there. Maybe you only need certain parts of these, and COBIT can guide you to determine this.
