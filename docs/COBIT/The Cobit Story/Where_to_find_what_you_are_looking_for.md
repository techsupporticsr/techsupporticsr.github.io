# Where to find what you are looking for
========================



The latest version of COBIT, COBIT 2019, includes four core publications. The first publication, Introduction and Methodology, explains the overall structure and the parts of the framework. It also introduces a governance system, components, governance and management objectives, and performance management, all areas that we'll be covering in this course. This is typically referred to as the Framework Guide. The second publication is called Governance and Management Objectives. This includes 40 objectives organized into five domains. Each objective is related to one process and guidance related to each of the governance components is included in this guide. The third publication is titled Designing an Information and Technology Governance Solution. Called the Design Guide for short, this introduces design factors and a design workflow that facilitates the creation of a tailored governance system and should be used with the Implementation Guide. Finally, the Implementation Guide, officially titled Implementing and Optimizing an Information and Technology Governance Solution, this provides a continual improvement life cycle approach with seven phases and three perspectives. Essentially, it is a very detailed methodology to adopting a tailored governance system described in the Design Guide. The majority of this course comes from the first publication, the Framework Guide. As we go through the details of COBIT, I will point you to where you can find that information in each of the COBIT publications. You can find this information on the ISACA site at isaca.org/cobit. Once there, find the Publications tab and scroll down the page to the core COBIT publications: Introduction and Methodology, Governance and Management Objectives, Design Guide, and Implementation Guide. The digital versions of these are free to ISACA members. If you're not a member, you can download the first two free with site registration and the last two can be purchased. 

In addition to the four primary publications, other complimentary guidance is also being continuously produced.
