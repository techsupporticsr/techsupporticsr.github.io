# What's in it for me?
========================



I like to say that there is something in COBIT for everyone at an organization. Whether you are in a business, IT, risk, or an audit role, COBIT has guidance that relates to you. A certain level of experience and a thorough understanding of the enterprise are required to benefit from the COBIT framework. This experience and understanding allows users to customize core COBIT guidance, which is generic in nature, into tailored and focused guidance for the enterprise, taking into account the enterprise's context. The target audience includes those responsible during the whole life cycle of the governance solution, from design to execution to assurance. COBIT has a wide range of stakeholders ranging from internal to external. First, let's take a look at those internal stakeholders and how each of them can benefit from COBIT. The internal stakeholders are within the organization and can gain valuable information on how to use COBIT to help create value based on their individual roles. Board members receive insights on how to get value from the use of enterprise information and technology and their relevant board responsibilities. Executive management gets guidance on how to organize and monitor performance of information and technology across the enterprise. Business management can understand how to obtain the information and technology solutions required and how best to exploit new technology for new strategic opportunities. IT management learns how to best build and structure the IT department, manage performance of IT, run an efficient and effective IT operation, control IT costs, and align IT strategy to business priorities. Assurance providers can learn more about how to manage dependency on external service providers, get assurance over IT, and ensure the existence of an effective and efficient systems of internal controls. Finally, risk management can recognize how to ensure the identification and management of all IT-related risk and how it can affect the enterprise. Now let's take a look at the external stakeholders. External stakeholders are not within the organization, but have significant interest in its success. COBIT can help them gain valuable information on how they can use the framework to provide, process and receive information that enables their value contribution. COBIT helps regulators ensure the enterprise is compliant with applicable rules and regulations and has the right governance system in place to manage and sustain compliance. COBIT helps business partners ensure that their operations are secure, reliable, and compliant with applicable rules and regulations. Finally, COBIT helps IT vendors ensure that their operations are also secure, reliable, and compliant with applicable rules and regulations. For each of the 40 governance and management objectives, COBIT identifies a set of roles and their applicability to each of the objectives. Here's a list of these roles. As you can see, there are many here, can you identify these in your organization? You could likely go through this list and see many familiar roles, but this may not be representative of your organizational structures. You may add, remove or modify any of these to fit your needs. This is not an all inclusive list. For example, I was in an organization that had several roles that are not identified here. Two of these were process owner and subject matter expert. We were able to create these roles based on the descriptions of many of those you see here and add them to our organizational model with no issues. COBIT also provides a short description of each of these roles. 

You can use the suggestion or change it to meet your specific needs.
