# Exploring the threat of cryptojacking
========================


One of the newest members of the cyber security threat landscape is cryptojacking. Also known as malicious cryptomining, this threat is the secret and unauthorized use of computers to mine for cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency mining is computationally complex and can consume a lot of computer resources, causing the computer to be slow to respond, shorten its lifespan or even destroy it. Because cryptocurrency mining can be expensive and make such a negative impact, attackers use system vulnerabilities and malware to target other systems to do the work. The first reported instances of cryptojacking happened in 2017, but even though cryptojacking is relatively new, it quickly outpaced ransomware in frequency of attacks. This is likely due to two reasons, declining profitability of ransomware attacks because the value of cryptocurrencies has decreased. Also the success of ransomware attacks has decreased as organizations become more aware of the threat and implemented effective protections. Second, much lower profile of cryptojacking attacks. Compared to ransomware which is designed to catch your attention, cryptojacking is meant to be stealthy and avoid detection as long as possible. The longer it operates in secret, the more cryptocurrencies it can mine for the attacker. This translates to more money for less risk. Cryptojacking comes in two forms. The first form attacks systems just like classic malware. You might open an infected file or click a malicious link that downloads malware directly to your system. It may seem like nothing happened, but the cryptomining software will start working continuously on your computer in the background. Newer versions of cryptojacking software are design to attack enterprises, attempting to spread the cryptomining software to as many systems in the network as possible. This happens when a website contains JavaScript code designed to instruct the browsers of visitors to that site to use their CPUs for cryptomining. Some sites will announce that this is happening to give visitors a choice to participate, but other sites won't ask permission and may even host versions of the code that work after you leave the site. There are even forms of drive-by cryptomining that work on Android phones. Because it's so stealthy, you may be a victim of cryptomining and not even notice. Ways to tell if your system is hosting malicious cryptomining software is if it seems unusually slow or the cooling fan runs excessively. But even if you don't see these symptoms, it doesn't mean you're not a victim. Just because it's relatively new doesn't mean cryptojacking isn't as important as some of the other members of the cyber security threat landscape. You can expect cryptojacking to continue to be a major security threat to both individuals and enterprises for some time.
