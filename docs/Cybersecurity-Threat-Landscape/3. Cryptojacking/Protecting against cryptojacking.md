# Protecting against cryptojacking
========================


Cryptojacking, otherwise known as Mushes Crypto Mining, can be challenging to protect against, largely because it's specifically designed not to be detected. 

But there are steps you can take to reduce the threat of this growing form of cyberattack. 

There are three ways to help prevent drive-by crypto mining, the form of cryptojacking that commands web browsers to use the CPUs of their visitors to mine crypto-currencies. First, figure out if your browser is vulnerable to cryptojacking, the software engineers behind the Opera web browser created a website that can tell if your browser could be the victim of cryptojacking, at cryptojackingtest.com. Just go to the site and click the Start button, it'll quickly let you know if your browser is protected or not. Make sure to test all browser types you use, since some may be vulnerable, even if others are not. Next, you can install browser extensions that are designed to block crypto mining JavaScript code. Examples include No Coin, NoScript, and Adblock Plus. Third, you can use browsers with built-in ad blockers, like Opera and Brave, these browsers will automatically prevent drive-by crypto mining. Here are three steps you can take to minimize the threat of the form of cryptojacking that's like classic malware. First, make sure all of your computers are protected with effective anti-malware software, with the most current malware definitions. Next, deploy security patches and updates to all of your computers, since vulnerabilities may be used to spread crypto mining attacks. And third, ensure that users receive security awareness training that teaches them ways to detect signs of cryptojacking and how to avoid attacks, like phishing and malicious links, which can be used to spread cryptojacking software. By implementing the controls covered in this video, you should be able to significantly reduce the threat of cryptojacking.
