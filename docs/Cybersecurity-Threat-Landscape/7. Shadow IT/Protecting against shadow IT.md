# Protecting against shadow IT
========================

Shadow IT, as the name implies, can be challenging to both detect and prevent. 

But I'll cover some specific actions you can take to reduce the likelihood and impact of shadow IT in your organization. 

First, let's look at what I call fundamental controls for protecting against shadow IT. 

These are steps you should be taking anyway, but if you aren't, your exposure to the shadow IT threat increases a lot.

The first fundamental control is you need to have an IT asset inventory. If you don't have a current inventory of your sanctioned IT assets, you won't be able to identify shadow IT systems. 

Run an Nmap scan or use a similar tool to get a baseline of systems currently on your network. 

Review the results to make sure all systems you found are authorized, and deal with any that aren't. 

Next, make sure users know about correct IT deployment processes. 

It's hard to blame users who don't follow the system when they didn't know what it was. 

Define a clear IT deployment process and write it down. 

Publish it in a place that's easy for users to find, and heavily promote it. 

Finally, implement and enforce strong security policies that prohibit unauthorized deployment of IT systems or solutions. 

Security policies should be approved by executive leadership and should clearly state what is allowed when it comes to IT deployments. 

That way, you'll have an answer when asked why shadow IT systems need to be removed. 

There are also several technology controls that will help keep shadow IT from becoming a serious problem in your organization.

First is security monitoring. 

Security monitoring systems, like a security information and event management system, or SIEM, can track all network activity and notify the IT or security team if an unauthorized system is added to the network. 

This may be an indication of shadow IT or another type of security incident. 

Next, consider ways to implement network access control, or NAC. This is a technical security restriction that only allows authorized systems, such as those with enterprise-issued certificates, from joining your network. 

With NAC in place, if a user attempted to add shadow IT systems to the network, they wouldn't be able to connect. 

Finally, consider using a cloud access security broker, or CASB. CASB is a technology that sits between users and the cloud services they try to use. CASBs can enforce security controls, as well as automatically scan the organization network infrastructure to detect any cloud-based applications in use. 



By implementing the fundamental and technology security controls I covered in this video, you should significantly reduce your exposure to the threat of shadow IT.
