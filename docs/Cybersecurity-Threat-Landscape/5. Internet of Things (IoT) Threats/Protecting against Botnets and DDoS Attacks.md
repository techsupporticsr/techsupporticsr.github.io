# Protecting against cloud-computing-based threats
========================


The number of internet of things or IOT devices is growing rapidly and so are the related threats when they are deployed in an unsecure way. The good news is that there are some straight forward steps you can take to protect your organization from the threat of unsecure IOT devices. It's important to understand though that some IOT devices are so poorly designed that they a be challenging to secure. They might allow you to change default passwords for instance. So we'll start by looking at a few effective security actions you can take at the network level even if the IOT devices themselves are hard to secure. First you should conduct a network asset inventory. Run network scans like nmap to know which systems and devices are on your network. Investigate any that are seem out of the ordinary and remove any unauthorized devices. Second is network segmentation. Now that you have an inventory of your network assets the next step is to identify which ones are your critical information assets and where they are in your network. Use your routers and switches to segment your network and isolate your critical assets from IOT devices as much as possible. Finally block ports. Figure out which network ports the IOT devices need and block traffic at the firewall for any other ports. Especially block telnet port 23 unless it's absolutely required. Telnet was the protocol that the mirai attack software used to compromise hundreds of thousands of IOT devices. Some IOT devices on the other hand are easier to secure. If that's the case then at a minimum implement the following. Change default passwords when possible. This is easily the most important way you can protect your organization and data from attacks against your IOT devices. Attackers know the most common IOT default passwords and will use them to compromise your devices. Changing the default password keeps these attacks from being successful. Next configure strong security if possible. Practice the least privilege principle and only give the device and accounts that access it the ability to do what they should be doing and no more. Set restrictive security controls on the device if that's an option. And third install software updates and patches. If the manufacturer is supporting their IOT devices with periodic software update and patches, make sure you install them in a timely manner. They may include important security fixes that will help protect your IOT devices from attacks. In 2018 the open web applications security project or OWASP published the IOT top ten which is a list of the key vulnerabilities to avoid when building, deploying or managing IOT systems. If you are responsible for securing IOT devices I recommend reviewing this list to make sure you've protected against all these vulnerabilities. By implementing these and the other protections I covered in this video you'll significantly reduce your exposure to the threat of unsecured IOT devices.
