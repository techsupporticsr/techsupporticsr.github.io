# Exploring the threat of phishing
========================


Phishing is a type of social engineering designed to trick users into sharing sensitive personal information like user names, passwords, and credit card details with attackers. Let's take a closer look at what phishing is and how it works. Phishing has been around since the 1990's, but it's still going strong. Comodo Cybersecurity's 2018 Global Threat Report lists email phishing as the most common method of attack. And according to Proofpoint's State of the Phish Report, credential compromise reports in 2018 rose 70% over 2017, and 280% since 2016. The most common phishing technique is to send a fraudulent email to a targeted user. The email is designed to look like it came from a trusted entity, and it will often appear urgent so the recipient will quickly open it. Typically the email will contain a manipulated link that looks like it goes to a real website. If the targeted user clicks the link, though, it goes to a forged website, designed to look like the real thing. Once there, the target will usually be prompted to enter their username and password for the site. If they do, the attacker will now have their login credentials for the real site. Depending on the site, this can turn into an immediate loss of information or money for the victim. One of the keys to a successful phishing attack, is making the emails look like they came from trusted sources. So phishing attackers frequently co opt trusted brands like Microsoft, PayPal, Google, DHL, and Dropbox. Phishing email subject lines often have a certain style. Here are examples of typical subject lines used in phishing emails: Your account will be locked, important, please log into your account to verify your info, and invoice due. Note how they sound urgent or at least important enough to not ignore. Phishing comes in a variety of forms including, untargeted phishing, which is like tossing out a big net trying to catch as many victims as possible, spearphishing on the other hand, customizes email attacks to specific users hoping the illusion of familiarity will create more trust, and whaling, which is spearphishing directed at senior business executives, who likely control significant financial assets. Comodo Cybersecurity's 2018 Global Threat Report states that enterprise users receive 16 to 20 malicious emails each month on average. Because email-based attacks are cheap, simple, and effective, we can expect that phishing attacks will continue to be one of the most common on the cybersecurity threat landscape.
