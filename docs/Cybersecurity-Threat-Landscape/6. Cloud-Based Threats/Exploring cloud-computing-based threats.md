# Exploring cloud-computing-based threats
========================

![img](/img/cloud.png)

Few technologies have had more impact on the security threat landscape than cloud computing. Let's take a look at some of the reasons behind this trend and explore the most common threats related to cloud computing. More organizations are adopting a cloud-first strategy and either building their computer infrastructure in the cloud or moving their on-premises computing services to cloud-based providers. They're doing this because, compared to on-premises solutions, cloud computing is believe to be easier to manage, quickly scalable, more convenient, and less expensive. Because of this trend, though, cloud-based computing is not only becoming a bigger target for attackers, it's also a growing source of attacks directed at both cloud-based and on-premises computer networks. Cloud-based computing is not only susceptible to many of the same threats as on-premises networks, it has it's own unique threats. To help define these, in 2016 the Cloud Security Alliance came out with the first version of a research report called The Treacherous 12: Top Threats to Cloud Computing. We'll walk through these to get a better understanding of cloud computing threats. First is data breaches. Simply put, data breaches happen whenever there is unauthorized access, theft, or release of protected information. Breaches can be due to intentional malicious acts or simple human error and as we've seen from years of news headlines, the impacts of data breaches on businesses can be catastrophic. Next is weak access management. Unfortunately some organizations still allow the use of simple passwords that are easily guessed or compromised through basic attacks or they fail to require changing of credentials periodically so once compromised, they continue to allow unauthorized access. Lack of role-based access and application of least privilege can also lead to inappropriate or unauthorized access to protected data. Third is weak API's and user interfaces. Application programming interfaces, or API's, and software user interfaces are how programs and users interact with cloud services. These are the most exposed parts of the cloud system by design. This makes them the targets of frequent attacks and if they're not adequately secured, they can allow quick access to attackers. Fourth is system vulnerabilities. These are program flaws that are exploitable by attackers to gain unauthorized access to cloud computing environments. Malicious actors will often start their attack by checking by system vulnerabilities that may exist. Unfortunately, old vulnerabilities that are well known to attackers still exist and are commonly exploited. Fifth is account hijacking. This is the theft of user credentials to access cloud data. Common attacks like phishing, fraud, or software vulnerabilities are just a few of the ways accounts can be hijacked. If the organization also has weak access management like mentioned earlier, then these accounts can often be reused to gain access to cloud data and launch further attacks. The next threat is malicious insiders. This includes anyone, current or former employees, contractors or business partners who abuses their authorized access to data. Malicious insiders can use their access to commit many types of attacks or steal data. Because these are authorized users, it can be very challenging to protect against malicious insiders. Number seven is Advanced Persistent Threats or APT's. Unlike most other attacks, these are sneaky, long-term attacks. Once on the system or network, an APT attacker will often move slowly, trying to blend in with regular activity as much as possible to avoid detection. These attacks can be initiated in many ways including through spear phishing, hack systems, and access through partner networks. Eighth is data loss. Data can be lost due to attacks, accidental deletion, physical disasters, and other reasons. Depending on the circumstances, either the cloud provided or the cloud user could be responsible for data loss. Responsibilities for data loss are often defined in cloud provider contracts so it's important to review the provisions and the agreements if there's any uncertainty. The ninth threat is poor due diligence. If an organization rushes to adopt cloud services without properly vetting the provider, they may start user a sub-standard service or provider. This can expose the organization to many risks. Due diligence also includes vetting the cloud services in place when merging with companies already in the cloud. Number 10 is abuse of cloud services. As mentioned earlier, cloud services themselves can be the source of attacks. Once compromised, cloud services can be used to launch distributed denial of service attacks, e-mail spam and phishing campaigns, hosting of malicious or pirated content and more. These forms of abuse can reduce storage and computing capacity in the cloud service. 11 is denial of service. This attack is designed to consume system resources or network bandwidth so much that it prevents users from accessing a service or data. Consumers and cloud users often get frustrated because they can't access their service or data. In extreme cases, denial of service attacks can last long enough to cause a business to lose revenue. And the 12th threat is shared technology. Because cloud providers have many customers, they must share resources like the physical computers, networks, and software platforms. If vulnerabilities exist in any of these shared resources, they could impact all tenants. This would be true for any cloud model you use whether it's infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, or software as a service. This has been a quick walkthrough of cloud computing-based threats. For more detail, I recommend going to the Cloud Security Alliance website and downloading the latest version of the Top Threats to Cloud Computing report.
