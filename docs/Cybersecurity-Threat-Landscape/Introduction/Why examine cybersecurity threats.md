# Why examine cybersecurity threats?
========================


First, let's talk about why we're concerned about cyber security threats in the first place. In the world of cyber security, the concept of risk is usually described as the product of impacts, vulnerabilities, and threats. Impacts are the ways your negatively affected by a successful cyber attack. Vulnerabilities are the flaws that exist in your security that allow the attack to succeed. And threats are the attacker and methods they use to conduct the attack. In this course I'll be focusing on cyber security threats because as military strategist Sun Tzu said, "If you know the enemy and know yourself, "you need not fear the result of a hundred battles." I'll recommend specific actions you can take to reduce your vulnerabilities and minimize your exposure to these threats. The goal is to decrease or even eliminate the impacts of these threats and better manage your cyber security risks. Because we want to follow specific actions to protect against these threats, I'll spend more time talking about the methods used by attackers versus the attackers themselves. It's more useful to look at ways to defend against the threat of cryptojacking for instance, rather than the broad category of hackers. So let's explore the cyber security threat landscape and learn what we can do to protect against some of the biggest threats.
