## Questions
========================

### Intro

Question 1 of 1

In the world of cybersecurity, the concept of risk is usually described as the product of impacts, threats, and vulnerabilities .
You are correct!
Feedback

When considered together, impacts, threats, and vulnerabilities can help you understand the overall risk.

### 1. Phishing

Question 1 of 2

Three steps you can take to reduce your exposure to phishing include block spam, use a password manager, and use multifactor authentication .
You are correct!
Feedback

Using multifactor authentication prevents an attacker from logging in with just a username and password.

Question 2 of 2

The most common phishing technique is to send a fraudulent email to a targeted user .
You are correct!
Feedback

Fake emails with manipulated links or malicious attachments are the most common methods to conduct phishing attacks.

### 2. Malware and Ransomware

Question 1 of 2
Applying security updates and patches can be an effective way to protect against both malware and ransomware.


You are correct!
TRUE

Feedback

You can significantly reduce your exposure to malware and ransomware attacks by making sure your systems have all their security updates and patches.

Question 2 of 2

There are two main ways that systems become infected with malware: system vulnerabilities and social engineering .
You are correct!
Feedback

Social engineering is used to trick users into installing malware.

### 3. Cryptojacking

Question 1 of 2
Which is NOT a way to protect against drive-by cryptomining?


You are correct!
installing antimalware software on your computer

Feedback

Because drive-by cryptomining targets vulnerable web browsers, installing antimalware software on your computer won't protect you from this threat

Question 2 of 2
Cryptojacking is a cyber attack that encrypts files and requires a payment in cryptocurrencies to remove the encryption.


You are correct!
FALSE

Feedback

This describes the threat of ransomware, not cryptojacking.

### 4. Botnets and DDoS Attacks

Question 1 of 2
Compromised systems that become part of a botnet are sometimes called drones because they are part of a larger "hive."


You are correct!
FALSE

Feedback

Compromised systems that become part of a botnet are sometimes called zombies because they are no longer able to control their own actions.


Question 2 of 2
Which is NOT a way that data centers protect against DDoS attacks?

installing security patches and updates on all data center systems
incident response
24/7 network monitoring
deploying firewalls, load balancers, and Intrusion Protection Systems

Question 2 of 2
Which is NOT a way that data centers protect against DDoS attacks?


You are correct!
installing security patches and updates on all data center systems

Feedback

Security patches and updates will not protect against DDoS attacks.


### 5. Internet of Things (IoT) Threats

Question 1 of 2
Which is NOT a key driver for the growth of IoT devices?

IoT devices have strong security controls compared to other Internet devices
the rise of cloud computing as the foundational technology for IoT
the plummeting cost of IoT devices
easy access to Wifi

Question 1 of 2
Which is NOT a key driver for the growth of IoT devices?

You are correct!
IoT devices have strong security controls compared to other Internet devices
Feedback

IoT devices are often more vulnerable than servers and network devices connected to the Internet.


Question 2 of 2
If your IoT device doesn't allow you to change the default password, there is nothing you can do to secure it.

TRUE
FALSE

You are correct!
FALSE

Feedback

Even if you can't change the default password on an IoT device, you can take other steps to secure them like network segmentation and blocking ports.


### 6. Cloud-Based Threats

Question 1 of 2
_____ are the most exposed parts of the cloud system by design. 

Database servers
Firewalls and load balancers
APIs and user interfaces
Network ports

Question 1 of 2

APIs and user interfaces are the most exposed parts of the cloud system by design.
You are correct!
Feedback

Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs, and software user interfaces are designed to be exposed because they are how programs and users interact with cloud services.


Question 2 of 2
Which is NOT a way to protect against Advanced Persistent Threats (or APTs)?

Strong access controls like multifactor authentication
network segmentation to minimize lateral movement
mantraps to prevent unauthorized access
network monitoring and response to identify and respond to any suspected security incidents

Question 2 of 2
Which is NOT a way to protect against Advanced Persistent Threats (or APTs)?


You are correct!
mantraps to prevent unauthorized access

Feedback

Mantraps are a physical security measure that would not be effective against APTs.

### 7. Shadow IT

Question 1 of 2
Shadow IT is a growing threat from malicious actors outside of your organization.

TRUE
FALSE

Shadow IT is a growing threat from malicious actors outside of your organization.


You are correct!
FALSE

Feedback

The threat of shadow IT comes from within your organization and many times it’s not malicious.

Question 2 of 2
_____ can be used to indicate the presence of shadow IT.

Closed circuit security cameras
Security monitoring systems
Antimalware
Firewalls

Security monitoring systems can be used to indicate the presence of shadow IT.
You are correct!
Feedback

Security monitoring systems like a Security Information and Event Management system (or SIEM) can track all network activity and notify the IT or security team if an unauthorized system is added to the network.
