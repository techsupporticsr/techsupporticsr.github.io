# Exploring malware and ransomware threats
========================


Malware has been a serious cyber security threat to both individuals and organizations since the late 1980s. And since ransomware has many of the same characteristics of most traditional forms of malware, it makes sense to examine them together. First, what is malware? Malware is a catch-all term for any software that is designed to gain unauthorized access to computers or network equipment with the goals of causing damage, extracting information, or making money for the attackers. Malware can take on many forms, including viruses, worms, trojans, rootkits, adware, and spyware. While there are many types of malware, the infection methods are often similar. There are two main ways that systems become infected with malware. The first is system vulnerabilities. These are flaws in hardware or software that allow malware to work. Usually patches exist to fix these vulnerabilities, but users and organizations don't always apply them in a timely manner, leaving themselves exposed. And even old vulnerabilities are still targeted by malware attackers. In 2019, researchers at Recorded Future found that attackers were still actively using a Microsoft vulnerability first identified in 2012 to deploy malware. The second most common way that systems get infected with malware is users falling prey to social engineering. This happens when attackers successfully convince a user to download infected software, open an infected email attachment, or connect an infected disk or drive. The system still needs to be vulnerable to the malware that the user introduces for it to work, though. Now let's look at ransomware. Ransomware is a form of malware that has a special purpose. It encrypts data and files on the infected computer and instructs the user to send the attackers money to recover their information. This can be a lucrative income stream for attackers. In 2017, the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center received 1,783 ransomware complaints that cost victims over $2.3 million. Of course, these were only the attacks that were reported. The actual number of attacks and money made is much higher. Although ransomware can use any of the malware attack techniques I mentioned earlier, one of the most common is the fake urgent email attachment designed to trick users into opening it. Due to their success, ransomware attacks have generated a lot of dramatic headlines, like this one about a county in the state of Georgia which paid a ransom of $400,000 to get their data back. As long as systems remain vulnerable and users keep falling for social engineering attacks, malware and ransomware will be continue to be serious members of the cyber security threat landscape.
