# Planning for change

Feeling a little nervous about this new, whiz-bang job management system you've just signed up for? 

Not quite sure how to go about getting started with BARK?

Don't worry, we've got your back.

Your dedicated Customer Experience (CX) Consultant will provide all the technical guidance you need to get BARK up and running. But there are also steps that you can take to drive positive change within your organisation.

*Here are 5 tips that will guarantee a smooth transition to BARK.*

## 1. Create your action plan

Taking the time to map out a simple action plan will set you on the right track to achieve your business goals with BARK. How much or how little detail you need to include depends on the size and complexity of your organisation.

Here are some key considerations to get you started:

*	Who will be responsible for managing your BARK rollout?
*	What are your critical business requirements in terms of workflow, training and equipment?
*	How do you want to go live: all at once or in stages? Do you plan to continue using your existing system(s) in parallel with BARK for a while?

Work with your CX Consultant to create a checklist of the key rollout tasks, or download one of ours (see below), then assign responsibilities and set realistic completion dates for each task. 

This will give you a good indication of when your business will be ready to go live with BARK. Most of our clients are up and running with BARK within about 4 to 6 weeks, and after six months, they're wondering how they ever did without it.

We recommend downloading and saving your checklist, or viewing it in a PDF reader.

## 2. Prepare your team for change

Change can be a real battle for some people, especially if they don't understand the purpose of it. 
Some of your team members may be thinking "if it ain't broke, don't fix it". 
This kind of sentiment can seriously hamper your efforts to introduce BARK into your business. 
That's why it is vital to plan for resistance to change from the start.

So, how do you get staff buy-in?
*	Explain the benefits that BARK offers:
*	increases speed of allocating tasks through automation
*	improves communication and response times
*	allows your business to stay competitive
*	ensures long term success, which ultimately, their jobs depend on.
*	Make it a company-wide project that involves all levels of staff. Get their input about changes that affect their daily tasks.
*	Most importantly, communicate often and regularly. Hold a kick-off meeting, provide 'lunch & learn' sessions, and send out regular emails to keep everyone in the loop.
 
## 3. Train a 'Top Dog'

Behind every successful BARK rollout is an BARK 'Top Dog'. A BARK 'Top Dog' is someone who dedicates their time to learning how to use and integrate BARK into your business processes.

As the business owner, you may want to 'Top Dog' the rollout process yourself. Alternatively, you can nominate someone within your organisation who has a good understanding of your internal processes and is comfortable with new technology and change management.

Ideally, the BARK 'Top Dog' should be involved throughout the rollout to help drive the process and promote staff involvement. It should also be their responsibility to document new processes along the way. 

After go-live, they will have gained the necessary skills and knowledge to become the go-to person for BARK related queries, support and training.

## 4. Prepare your data

We want you to hit the ground running with BARK, which is why we offer to import your existing customer/supplier contacts and inventory/asset registers. But before you start compiling your data files, remember: Garbage in = Garbage out.

Taking out the garbage before it goes into your new BARK database will save you from headaches later on. Try to set aside some time to clean up your contact lists - remove any duplicate contacts and ensure you're using consistent naming conventions, e.g. Pty Ltd or Proprietary Limited.

If you're keen to take full advantage of BARK's job automation, send us a support request with examples of your work order emails so that we can ensure everything is set up and ready to go.
 
## 5. Get the right equipment

If your organisation is still using worksheets or a notice board to keep track of jobs, it's time to get rid of it!

Your field technicians will now be able to access their jobs from anywhere, using any mobile device. 

And just like using the right tool for the job, using the right device makes all the difference. 

The easier BARK is to use, the happier your team will be to adopt it.

BARK was designed to be a mobile first application, that means all our field forms, including the ones you will create, will be perfectly suited to a mobile phone.

When choosing a device, think about the tasks that are critical to the individual's role. Can these tasks be achieved using BARK's Field or Office interfaces?
*	Smartphones - suitable for BARK Field.
*	Tablet devices - suitable for BARK Field, and also provide enough screen space to easily use most features in BARK Office.
*	Laptops - suitable for both BARK Field and Office.

If taking pictures is a big part of the job, make sure your mobile plans have sufficient data allowance for uploading images to BARK. A 1GB plan should be adequate.

Finally, learning new technology can take time. 

That's why we encourage you and your team to get a head start with our interactive online tutorials. 

They're also a great way to reinforce your learning between training sessions with your CX Consultant.
