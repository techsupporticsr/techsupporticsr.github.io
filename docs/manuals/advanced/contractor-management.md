# Contractor Management

Contractor Management is a HUGE part of BARK, and one of your biggest selling tools when it comes time to tender & sell, particularly to large National & International Brands, so it Is imperative you get compliance from Contractors.
Their time is important to them and so it is to you. After all, time is money. When your contractor weighs up WHY they should use your BARK system, give them all the information to make an informed decision. Below you see the maths on it making a pretty clear case, ie saving time and money.
To be a good CO-OPERATIVE customer to your contractors, try to require LESS time per month than their other customers and pay early! With BARK automatic invoicing AND payments, offering your customers 2.5% off if they choose automatic payment, while Contractors may accept 4% off if they get the same instant payment from you.

Contractor Admins who do larger runs for you will enjoy using the same page to order and allocate you do.

Having Contractors able to either a) choose auto invoicing (BARK will generate an invoice on their behalf) or b) upload their own from mobile or PC where BARK will check Invoiced $ vs jobs complete, then allowing them instant payments (at discounted rates) is a great way to co-operate and make their lives easier

For Contractors, just like you, the onus comes OFF their admin staff and data entry and onto a few secs of the team in the field, saving everyone time & money AND reporting instantly.
