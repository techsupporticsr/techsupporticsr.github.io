# Sign on for Duty

## Getting to the Page

The Sign on for Duty Form is typically automatically accessed via a redirect upon clicking the "Sign on" Icon (green clock) for the day, job or shift in the User's Timesheet page.

The page defaults to a "NEW" blank report ready to complete.

In order to make signing on as fast and easy as possible, the report pre-populates some fields such as the site, depot, team member details.

The current date / time is populated into datetime fields as the form is filled in. 

## Personal Details

You may not need a picture of operative if PPE (safety gear), dress code, uniform and presentation standards do not apply. 

Any field can be hidden or left showing, and can be either compulsory or non-compulsory.

More fields can be added from the Personal Details page, such as phone number, employee number etc

## Licence Details

Attachment / Picture of licenses / accreditations / permits required.

Files can be either taken as an image, or uploaded / linked as a file (eg pdf).\

Multiple licenses can be placed next to each other and taken as one picture for convenience. 

Image fields for licences and permits are great for those required to be HELD ON THE PERSON, such as a security or drivers license.

File Uploads are great for longer, more detailed documents, eg: Insurances where the entire file can be stored rather than a single image of a page.

Links are great for accreditations that are authored and maintained by third parties.

## NEW FEATURE - GOVERNMENT LICENSING API

Recently, the NSW and other governments have opened live licensing checks through APIs. BARK has created a bot and API to check live against the current government records at sign on.

The page will display the current status. It will also show and send an *ALERT FOR AN EXPIRED OR REVOKED LICENCE*.

NB; If you have a 2 out run, a driver and an escort. 2 operatives 1 car. Escort should only need to do equipment sign out, and driver only do vehicle details, and obviously 1 out does the lot. Maybe there can be a choice after first compliance tick list e.g. "Driver/Escort"   "Driver"  and "Escort" .
