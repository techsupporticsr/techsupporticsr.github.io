# How DevOps Security Practices differ from other Security Approaches

DevOps security or DevSecOps is a holistic mindset approach rather followed by community-driven effort than a one-man size fits all approach in the standard security world.

DevSecOps focuses on building secure software by implementing security standards at each and every part of the DevOps pipeline from developing to the source code till deploying the application. Whereas standard security practices start after the deploying of the application.

Approach of an organization with DevSecOps is to make each and every person responsible for the software delivery to implement their own security practices. Each one is responsible for security measures.

DevOps Security focuses on the point of delivering secure software using continuous delivery architectures. It is community driven effort and strategy driven by learning and experiments.
