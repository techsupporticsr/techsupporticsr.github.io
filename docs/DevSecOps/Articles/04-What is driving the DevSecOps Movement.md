# What is driving the DevSecOps Movement

As software continues to grow at a rapid pace in IT DevSecOps becomes the foundation of competitiveness in the modern marketplace. Every business must become an agile and innovative software delivery machine in order to survive.

Which leads all of us to the enterprise IT paradox: go faster and innovate. But always stay secure. Modern Applications are mostly “assembled.” Developers often use and download vulnerable open source components and applications frameworks. In the DevOps world organizations are building applications at such a faster rate that they have forgotten the Security aspect. Cloud platforms and continuous delivery life cycles often circumvent traditional security process and checks.

Security Collaboration — it’s everyone’s responsibility. Organizations must try to bring individuals of all abilities to a high level of proficiency in a short period of time.
