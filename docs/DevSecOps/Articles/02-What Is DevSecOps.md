#  What is DevSecOps?
DevSecOps is a practice of implementing security at every step in the DevOps Lifecycle. According to the traditional method where penetration tests and vulnerability assessment was done after the build, DevSecOps is based on the concept of integrating security assessments and vulnerability tests at each point of the CI/CD pipeline. DevSecOps implements security within the DevOps workflow.

DevSecOps is the answer to integrating various enterprise challenges into a coherent and effective approach to software delivery. 
A central tenet of DevSecOps is that security is an integral and essential element of DevOps - the method by which enterprises innovate at speed and scale.
