# DevSecOps Questions

## Testing

### What makes a good Test?
- Runs Fast (otherwise it won't be used)
- Doesn't Break Often (otherwise no trust, and won't be used)
- Easy to Read and Understand BY EVERYONE 
- Catches Bugs (Works! Doesn't allow )
- Good Coverage to Effort Ratio for the Organisational / Application Risk Appetite 


Share and Communicate the Test Building results!
Share and Communicate the Test Building STRATEGY!

Testing UI is harder than script test!
Mocking too much reduces test quality
More Isolation means less bugs caught
