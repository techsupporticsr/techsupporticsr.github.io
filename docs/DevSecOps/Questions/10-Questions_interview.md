# DevSecOps Likely Questions for Interview
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DevSecOps is about introducing security earlier in the life cycle of application development, thus minimizing vulnerabilities and bringing security closer to IT and business objectives.

** To land that DevSecOps dream job, prepare to answer questions not only about specific IT and security tools, but about DevOps team culture as a whole.**


As enterprises look to infuse security into all aspects of a DevOps workflow -- a practice known as DevSecOps -- they need to make sure their staff can keep up.


Any DevOps interview is likely to focus on a candidate's knowledge of coding languages, practices, tools and frameworks. But when the interview turns to security -- or is focused on a DevSecOps role, specifically -- IT professionals need to be prepared.

Check out some sample DevSecOps interview questions below to know what to expect.

**Editor's note**: _DevSecOps has gained traction as a way to minimize security risks that span code creation to application deployment. Learn more about how to [apply security best practices](https://searchitoperations.techtarget.com/tip/DevOps-security-best-practices-span-code-creation-to-compliance) to each step of the DevOps workflow before heading into an interview._[](https://searchitoperations.techtarget.com/tip/DevOps-security-best-practices-span-code-creation-to-compliance)

## What role has security played in your DevOps experience?

> Interviewers ask this intentionally broad question to lead job candidates into the DevOps security discussion and to gauge the importance of security in their prior DevOps work. There is no wrong answer, but be sure to discuss your involvement in security goals [along the pipeline](https://searchitoperations.techtarget.com/tip/Implement-security-for-DevOps-across-the-board). This can include code design best practices, code evaluation and testing for known vulnerabilities and intrusion scanning in the production environment. This question, and your response, sets the stage for additional or more specific questions.

 I am possibly unique in the fact that I was a Security and Risk Management Profesional long before I was a "coder".

 I therefore learned to write code from a Security FIRST mindset, rather than having security as an after thought or post-development problem.

 One of my core businesses was ASAP Armoured, a national fleet of covert armed guards in armoured cars and trucks, delivering cash to and from banks in the millions of dollars, including all racecourses and TABs when cash was still king.

 With that level of secrecy, data HAD to be protected. I protected the data like lives depended on it, because they did.

 Before OAUTH existed I found our own custom ways of authenticating users through things like our bespoke facial recognition sign-in App.

 I believe security doesn't have to mean cost, and it doesn't have to mean slower, the Facial Recognition App we created is a good example, it led to another income stream for us as I developed and built the world's first self-sign in Contractor and Concierge Kiosks to use the Facial Recognition Software - even outdoors and remote.

 With DevSecOps, security officers are constantly aware of application protection and can calmly and confidently approve a specific build for release. Most importantly, the security awareness of the organization as a whole increases, and more attention and budget are directed toward the goal of achieving a secure production environment.

## How do you test and fix vulnerabilities or security flaws?

> This DevSecOps interview question is intended to gauge a candidate's hands-on involvement in security issues. Respond in a way that reinforces your basic knowledge of [security in DevOps processes](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/tip/Shifting-security-left-How-to-pivot-from-DevOps-to-DevSecOps) and provides more detail about your adherence to sound security practices throughout the workflow, including how you developed those practices through team discussions and reporting. How exactly you test and fix flaws isn't nearly as important as the fact that you've been directly involved in software development security.

## What tools have you used for DevSecOps?

> Again, this question gauges the candidate's hands-on experience, particularly with the security tools the prospective employer uses, such as those for vulnerability checks, testing, systems and change management, and intrusion detection and prevention. Typically, it's not necessary for a candidate to be an expert in every tool, but it's helpful [to at least be familiar with](https://searchitoperations.techtarget.com/answer/What-is-the-best-DevOps-tool-for-my-career) tools the employer uses to expedite training. However, if the employer lists specific tools in the [job requirements](https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/devsecops-engineer-jobs-SRCH_KO0,18.htm), be sure to learn more about them before the interview.

## DevOps

### 1. Slack
SlackLaunched in the year 2013, Slack is still one of the top communication tools used by teams for effective collaboration on projects. This tool in the DevOps arsenal is used by technical organizations across the globe to tear down barriers and offer all team members a clear insight into the workflow. One exciting feature about Slack is that it allows developers to collaborate using toolchains in the same environment they are communicating with other maintenance and service members.

### 2. Jenkins
JenkinsAn open-source continuous integration server, Jenkins automates the complete build cycle of a software project. The USP of this tool is the Pipeline feature it offers, which can be utilized by the developers to automatically commit code into the repository, run test cases, as well as fetch reports obtained after testing. This highly customizable tool provides instant feedback and hence will warn you if a particular sprint is leading to a broken build or is harming the same. Most of the tasks and tools involved in SDLC can be automated using Jenkins, allowing team members to increase their throughput.

### 3. Docker
DockerDocker is a tool which is at the centre of containerization, a trend which is quickly gaining momentum in the IT world. Docker allows secure packaging, deploying and running of applications irrespective of the running environment. Every application container contains the source code, supporting files, run time, system config files, etc. responsible for application execution. Using the Docker Engine, the containers can be accessed which in turn can execute applications in a remote environment. The app has allowed organizations to reduce infrastructure costs. According to a report, 2 out of 3 companies who have tried this application have adopted it within 30 days of using it.

### 4. Phantom
PhantomSecurity of software is one of the prime concerns of any DevOps team. As such, the Phantom tool comes as a great help to developers who wish to build a defensible infrastructure from the very beginning of SDLC. Using the phantom tool, you can collaborate in a centralized environment on an incident and be aware of the rising security threats at the same time. The tool further gives DevOps professionals an option to mitigate such risks instantaneously using techniques such as file detonation, device quarantine, etc.

### 5. Nagios
NagiosSimilar to Phantom, Nagios is also a monitoring tool which tends to keep tabs on the applications, servers as well as your overall business infrastructure. The tool comes in as a great help for large organizations which have a countless number of circuitry (routers, servers, switches, etc.) in the backend. It alerts the users in case a particular fault occurs on the backend or any device fails. It also regularly maintains a performance chart and monitors trends to alert the user of a possible failure which may occur.

### 6. Vagrant
VagrantA vagrant is a tool for managing and working with virtual machines in a single workflow. Using Vagrant, team members can share software running environment and can test applications faster without wasting time on setting up configurations. The tool ensures that the environment for a particular project remains the same across every developer's machine, and the excuse of ‘runs-on-my-system' can be thrown out of the window.

### 7. Ansible
AnsibleAnsible is one of the most simple yet effective IT orchestration and configuration management tools available in the market. Compared to its competitors such as Puppet and Chef, which are loaded with features, Ansible offers a softer outlook and doesn't hog on your device's resources in the background. This tool is primarily utilized for pushing new changes within the existing system, as well as configuring newly deployed machines. Lowering the costs of infrastructure and increasing the replication speed of scalability are just two of the reasons which have made this an absolute favourite amongst IT companies.

### 8. GitHub
GitHubLaunched in the year 2000, GitHub remains as one of the top DevOps tools for easy collaboration. Using this tool, developers can make rapid iterations to the code, the notification of which is sent instantaneously to other team members. In case of any error or fallout, immediate rollbacks can be done to the previous version within seconds, thanks to the branched history of changes which are stored contiguously within the tool.

### 9. Sentry
SentrySentry, a tool used by companies such as Uber and Microsoft, is one of the best DevOps tools for error or bug detection. This free tool supports languages such as Ruby, IOS, JavaScript, etc. and further has inbuilt SDKs which can be customized for supporting most languages and frameworks. The tool continuously scans lines of code across the entire system and sends notifications if it finds an error or problem. Not only does it highlight the problem, but offers a choice of possible solutions which can be incorporated with a single click.

### 10. BitBucket
BitBucketSimilar to GitHub, BitBucket is also a tool which helps manage project code throughout the software development cycle. While GitHub still ranks as the top repository, people are shifting to BitBucket due to its reduced cost as well as the feature of the private repository (a feature only available in the paid variant of GitHub). While the core functionality of BitBucket resembles that of GitHub, features such as easy integration with Jira and Trello, inbuilt CI/CD functionality tend to give this tool by Atlassian an edge.



## What was the biggest security issue you faced, and how did you resolve it?

> Here's the nitty gritty: An anecdotal question that examines a candidate's direct involvement in a genuine security issue. That issue, whether a simple [buffer overflow](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/buffer-overflow) or a malicious hack, doesn't matter. Instead, discuss your experience with a security issue in a DevOps environment, and tell the interviewer about your specific involvement in the discovery and resolution of that issue. Be sure to include the follow-up steps you took, the lessons you learned and how you adjusted processes to avoid a similar issue in the future.

In 2011, one of our competitors hired an ex-employee to "build us a website like theirs".

Obviously he couldn't as our software was millions of lines of code over decades, so he tried stealing files using not just his credentials, but other developers' sign in information.

Fortunately, what he was not priviledge to, was the knowledge that ALL password attempts were logged and rejections were flagged. 

Any login attempt from an expired login would create a block of that machine which could only be unblocked by senior management. 

Shortly after that didn't work we received emails with suspicious attachments. Luckily he didn't wait too long so we were all hyper vigilant.

But it was good timing rather than good management, and so the email issue needed fixing.

I looked into all sorts of filters and security measures, but the simple truth remained, if it was a directed attack and care taken to encase it in what looked like a legitimate email, we were at risk of someone clicking it. 

At my direction, my team and my IT provider together created a net to catch all emails with attachments or certain conditions which we could add, these emails were 
1. held in quarantine external to our network, and 
2. were converted to txt files which were sent with a warning alert and a link back through a port which could not be opened from devices attached to our network, and
3. sent the user a notification that the email could not be read without further identification.

All staff, customers, suppliers etc were online working in our cloud and our aim was to make emailing files redundant. 
Eventually emails, even external (except for spam of course), nearly stopped altogether.




## How do developers and operations teams work together to protect security?

> This DevSecOps interview question is meant to examine a candidate's [communication and collaboration skills](https://searchitoperations.techtarget.com/opinion/Get-into-DevOps-with-cross-functional-skills-and-culture) -- which are critical in a DevOps environment -- rather than security knowledge. Discuss situations where you helped share information between teams or team members to enhance security across the DevOps pipeline in a collaborative way.

DevOps practices have shed new light on the security issues that span application design through deployment. Developers and operations staff must collaborate to deliver each software iteration with the necessary design, testing, tools and infrastructure to [protect against](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/feature/Exception-handling-best-practices-call-for-secure-code-design) malicious activity and maintain compliance.

Whether you're a developer or a dedicated IT security professional, it's critical to understand and apply [DevOps security](https://searchitoperations.techtarget.com/news/252465459/Alaska-Airlines-charts-course-for-DevOps-security) best practices.

Security is and should be, one of the main concerns of any software organization in the years to come. DevSecOps helps all stakeholders stay on top of an application's security and protection status, as well as confidently approve or deny a new release for production. There are different tools that can assist with implementing security in the continuous development process, but the right attitude and culture change (if necessary) must come from the teams themselves. Also, management must budget for and legitimize security activities. Once implemented correctly, DevSecOps can significantly improve the efficiency, quality, and of course, security of the whole software, allowing organizations to release new content to production quickly and efficiently.

### Security skills spread across the DevOps pipeline

Software bugs, poor design practices, malicious hacks, and weak or inconsistent hardware configurations have all conspired to plague enterprise applications since the digital age's inception. But security has largely been [treated as an afterthought](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252436268/Security-remains-an-afterthought-in-DevOps), or as a separate component from software and its operational infrastructure. A security team would detect a problem, analyze the cause and address the issue with a remediation, such as a system configuration change or software patch.

As software development velocity increases with the adoption of continuous approaches, such as Agile and DevOps, traditional security measures struggle to keep pace. DevOps enables quicker software creation and deployment, but flaws and vulnerabilities proliferate much faster. As a result, organizations must systematically change their approaches to integrate security throughout [the DevOps pipeline.](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/feature/5-tips-to-jump-start-a-DevOps-pipeline)

To get started, apply DevOps security best practices to these five key areas:

**Code creation.** [Software security](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/news/252468053/Black-Hat-2019-keynote-Software-teams-must-own-security) often starts with the codebase. Developers grapple with countless oversights and vulnerabilities, including [buffer overflows](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/buffer-overflow); authorization bypasses, such as not requiring passwords for critical functions; overlooked hardware vulnerabilities, such as [Spectre and Meltdown](https://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/tip/Spectre-and-Meltdown-vulnerabilities-show-haste-makes-waste); and ignored network vulnerabilities, such as OS command or SQL injection.

The emergence of APIs for software integration and extensibility opens the door to security vulnerabilities, such as lax authentication and data loss from unencrypted data sniffing. Developers' responsibilities increasingly include security awareness: They must use security best practices to [write hardened code](https://searchitoperations.techtarget.com/tip/Build-up-a-DevSecOps-pipeline-for-fast-and-safe-code-delivery) from the start and spot potential security weaknesses in others' code.

**Code testing.** Security is an important part of build testing within the [DevOps workflow](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/news/252473329/Atlassian-CISO-Adrian-Ludwig-shares-DevOps-security-outlook), so developers should deploy additional tools and services to analyze and evaluate the security posture of each new build. Use certain tool suites, such as Veracode, GauntIT and Mittn, to find and fix security flaws in binaries, or to perform detailed penetration testing to test a build for vulnerabilities. Fix any exposed vulnerabilities in subsequent iterations before deployment.

**IT infrastructure.** Operations traditionally bears the greatest IT security responsibility. But because DevOps integrates development and operations -- and more developers independently deploy builds to the IT infrastructure -- reconsider infrastructure's role in workload security.

In line with DevOps security best practices, operations teams need to carefully and consistently configure and provision every server, switch or other device within the infrastructure to prevent issues. For example, consider the potential risk of an enterprise server that overlooks a simple security practice and uses a default administrative password. Document and log configuration changes, and subject them to security audits. While these are commonly systems management and change management tasks, they will be critical in a DevOps delivery and deployment workflow.

**Everyday operations.** Security concerns persist when a build goes live on an enterprise server. That software serves the business and is the possible target of countless external and internal threats. Some organizations maintain a supplemental security team that uses varied [threat detection and mitigation tools](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/tip/Top-five-free-enterprise-network-intrusion-detection-tools) to supervise workloads and infrastructure. This team monitors workload and network performance metrics, checks for network anomalies or intrusions, and analyzes application and server logs. While IT security staff typically handles these responsibilities, developers receive monitoring results.

**Corporate compliance.** Software and infrastructure flaws that compromise workload security or availability also jeopardize corporate compliance. If a workload and its environment lack proper security, the business might violate agreements -- even if no malicious act or loss occurs -- and risk fines or litigation. Therefore, DevOps teams must interact with application stakeholders and business leaders to ensure workloads meet regulatory or industry [compliance requirements](https://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/feature/Cloud-compliance-strategies-for-a-multi-cloud-world).

### Training and education

Knowledge is the best way to [prevent IT security problems](https://searchitoperations.techtarget.com/tip/5-IT-security-measures-to-safeguard-distributed-environments), so DevOps teams should receive formal and informal security training. Staff can pursue comprehensive certifications, such as [CompTIA Security+](https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/security#examdetails) or the [ISO 27001 certification](https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html) in information security management systems.

Developers and operations staff should also [create and maintain](https://searchitoperations.techtarget.com/opinion/Lets-develop-best-practices-for-security-in-DevOps) concrete DevOps security best practices and policies for the organization. This is critical in environments where a high degree of automation orchestrates workflows and provisions resources.
