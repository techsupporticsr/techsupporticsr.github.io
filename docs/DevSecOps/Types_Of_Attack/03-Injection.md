# Injection
Injection is a broad category of attack vectors that enables an attacker to supply (inject) untrusted input into a program, which then changes the way the program executes. Attackers can also use injection attacks to plant malware on a computer, for example, to enable an attacker to execute remote commands. There are many types of injection attacks, a common one being SQL injection, which enables an attacker to manipulate SQL statements and gain control of a system’s database.
