# Security and risk management
========================

![img](/img/intro.png)


- Hi, I'm Mike Chapple, and I'd like to welcome you to our CISSP security and risk management course. The certified information system security professional, or CISSP certification, is the gold standard for information security certification. You'll find that it's a core requirement for many mid and senior level cybersecurity positions. Earning the CISSP requires demonstrating that you have sufficient work experience and passing an exam covering the eight domains of information security. This course covers the first of those eight domains, security and risk management. 15% of the questions on the CISSP exam come from this domain. I have two decades of experience as an information security professional, and I've been involved in CISSP training and certification for most of those. As we work our way through this course, we'll focus on each topic covered by domain one. We'll review the concepts of confidentiality, integrity, and availability in information security. We'll also cover security governance and risk management issues as well as the legal, regulatory, and compliance environment effecting security professionals. You'll learn about the importance of security policies and the security awareness and education framework. And that's just a small sampling of the many topics covered in this course. These topics, combined with the information you learn in our other CISSP courses, will help you pass the CISSP exam and also provide a critical foundation for your career in information security.
