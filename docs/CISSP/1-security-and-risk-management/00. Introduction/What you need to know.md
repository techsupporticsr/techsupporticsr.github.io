# What you need to know
========================

![img](/img/intro.png)


This course is designed for students who already have some hands-on experience in cybersecurity. Remember, you'll need either five years of full-time cyber security work experience or four years of experience and a college degree in a related field before you can earn the CISSP credential. If you don't yet have the required experience, you can still take the exam and this course will help you prepare. After passing the exam, you'll then have six years to gain the required experience and become a fully certified CISSP. If you're a security professional with some work experience under your belt, this course will help you fill in any gaps in your knowledge and build a solid foundation as you prepare to take the CISSP exam.
