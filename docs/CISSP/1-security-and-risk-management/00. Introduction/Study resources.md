# Study resources
========================

![img](/img/intro.png)


The courses on this site contain all of the information that you'll need to pass the CISSP exam. I've worked with thousands of students over the years and helped them successfully pass this test. Along the way, I've found that different people learn in different ways and the best way to prepare for the exam is to use a diverse set of resources. In addition to these courses, there are three other study resources that I recommend to help you prepare for the test. I've selected each of them with you in mind to help you learn the CISSP material, prepare for the test, and pass the exam on your first try. The first is the "Official CISSP Study Guide" available from Sybex. I wrote this book with my coauthors and it's approved by the International Information System Security Certification Consortium as the official study guide for the CISSP exam. This book contains context that supplements what you'll find in this course and it will help you be better prepared when you take the CISSP exam. David Seidl and I also prepared the official "CISSP Practice Tests," also available from Sybex. This book contains 1,300 practice exam questions designed to simulate those that you'll find on the actual test. The book has an entire chapter dedicated to questions from each domain, along with four full-length practice tests to help you assess your progress. Finally, I also recommend that you visit my website at certmike.com and sign up for my free CISSP study group. I'll send you emails to help keep you on track for the exam along with free practice tests, study tips, and other resources to get you ready for test day. If you visit certmike.com now and click the CISSP link, you'll be able to sign up for the free study group and I'll send you an email with links to resources that will help you pass the exam.
