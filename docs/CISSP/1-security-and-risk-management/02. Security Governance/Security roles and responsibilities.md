Security roles and responsibilities may differ between organizations but there are several common themes that exist across almost all businesses. The senior information security leader in an organization is commonly known as the Chief Information Security Officer or CISO. Now this title is also sometimes pronounced see-so. In some organizations, the CISO may have a different title such as Director of Information Security or Chief Security Officer. Another difference between organization lies in where the CISO reports. In some cases, the CISO reports to the Chief Information Officer, an organization's most senior IT leader. In other cases, the CISO reports to a risk management or audit function, providing a degree of separation between the individual responsible for IT and the individual responsible for ensuring that IT has effective security controls. The CISO normally leads a team of information security professionals. The size of that team will vary depending upon the size of the organization, the nature of the business, and the specific responsibilities assigned to information security as opposed to other technology units. This may include security generalists with a broad background across all the domains of information security, and/or specialists who focus on particular areas such as incident response, network security, identity and access management, and security awareness. All of the members of an information security team must follow important guiding principles for their role. One of these is the principle of due care. Due care says that security professionals must fulfill the legal responsibilities of the organization as well as the professional standards of information security. They must exercise the reasonable level of care that would be expected of any security professional. The second principle is that of due diligence. Due diligence says that security professionals should take reasonable measures to investigate the risks associated with a situation. For example, if the organization is considering implementing a major new customer relationship management system, security professionals should use due diligence and investigate the security controls available with that system and ensure that they meet the organization's security objectives.
