# Organizational processes
========================

As a business function, information security must align itself with the many other functions taking place inside an organization. Now, we already talked about some of the routine administrative tasks that information security leaders take on when they're managing human resources and financial budgets. Those are pretty much the same concerns that any other manager in the organization has. Let's take a look at the specific business processes that have a real security impact. First, information security must align itself with the governance processes of the organization. These governance processes take place at many different levels. They may consist of an information governance committee that includes senior leaders with oversight of information security and data governance functions. The organization may also have a risk management committee consisting of executives charged with managing all risks to the organization. In publicly traded companies and non-profit organizations, the most senior level of governance is typically an independent board of directors, board of trustees, or similar senior governing body with elected members. No matter what the governance structure of the organization, security leaders must determine the best ways to fit information security into that process. At a minimum, this means making sure that those responsible for the governance of the organization understand the security risks facing the organization and the controls put in place to manage those risks. Governing groups should also be informed of any security incidents that take place and rise to a serious level, and they should review the results of audits performed at the organization that include security considerations. There is no one-size-fits-all model for security governance and you'll need to figure out how to best address security concerns within the specific context of your organization. Another corporate process that requires security involvement comes from the acquisition of other companies. In some industries, it's quite common for businesses to buy other businesses and then seek to quickly fold them into the parent company. Each acquisition presents a unique set of circumstances and security professionals from both organizations should get together to evaluate the security controls in place at each organization and figure out how to eliminate redundancies and ensure compatibility between systems. Now this can be a little tricky, especially when the staff at one organization fears that they may be laid off as a result of the acquisition. Threats to a team's continued employment can have a very serious negative impact on productivity. Similarly, companies sometimes undergo divestitures where they spin off a part of the business as a separate organization. In those cases, individuals staying with the divested company must ensure that the new organization has adequate security controls in place. Those staying with the parent company will need to ensure that all security ties are cut and that there isn't any unintentional access left over for employees who leave with the divestiture.
