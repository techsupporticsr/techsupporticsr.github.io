# Social networking
========================

While many people view social networking as a way to chat with friends and share career and personal updates, organizations take social networking very seriously. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn are valuable business tools that organizations may use to connect with customers, communicate with stakeholders, and recruit potential employees. It's very important to implement strong security practices designed to keep those social networking accounts secure. One of the most common attacks against corporate social media accounts is when an attacker hijacks an account. This commonly occurs when an account has a weak password or the attacker manages to use social engineering to trick a customer service representative into granting them account access. For example, Tesla recently had their Twitter account hacked, and the perpetrator posted this tweet, advertising that Tesla was giving away vehicles to anyone who called a listed phone number. And that phone number belonged to a computer repair shop in Illinois that was inundated with phone calls. The easiest way to protect your organization against these attacks is to use multi-factor authentication on social media accounts. All of the major social networks provide this functionality. Many organizations use third-party tools to assist in managing their social media accounts. Tools like Buffer and Hootsuite allow many different people to manage multiple social media accounts across organizations, and they include features like approval workflows for posts, the scheduled release of posts, the management of comments and replies, and the tracking of statistics. Organizations that use social media management tools should ensure that they evaluate those tools just as they would any other cloud service. Tools grant access to social media accounts, and they should be carefully protected. Finally, organizations should adopt formal social media policies that help employees understand their obligations when using social media in either official or unofficial capacities. Let's take a look at the contents of one such policy from IBM. IBM's Social Computing Guidelines walk through a reasonable introduction on why social media is important to the business and what the expectations are of employees. Then here in the Executive Summary, we can see what the organization's expectations are of IBM employees who engage on social media. First, they say that any use of social media is subject to IBM's Business Conduct Guidelines, and then they go through what items are an individual responsibility and what's a corporate responsibility on social media and how employees should identify themselves when they're interacting about topics that relate to their work at IBM and those that aren't relevant to their work at IBM. And the use of social media can be a valuable business tool, but organizations must also ensure that they consider and address the associated security risks.
