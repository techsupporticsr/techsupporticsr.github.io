# Employee termination process
========================

Every employee eventually leaves the organization for one reason or another. In the happiest case, they're retiring after years of successful employment. In other cases, they're voluntarily leaving because they found a more attractive position. And sometimes the termination is on less positive grounds and the employee is being forced out of the organization through layoffs or firing. No matter what the reason, it's very important that security teams play a role in the employee termination process. Organizations should do everything they can to make an employee separation as pleasant as possible within the constraints of the employee's specific circumstances. One way to do this is through an exit interview, usually conducted by a senior manager or a member of the human resources department. Exit interviews are used to gather information about the employee's experience at the company and wish them well in their future endeavors. Exit interviews are also a useful time to gently remind the employee about their responsibilities under the nondisclosure agreement that they signed when they were hired, and remind them that they must continue to protect confidential information even after they leave the organization. And it's tricky to do this well because you don't want to offend the employee, but you do want to offer that reminder. One good way to do this is by saying something like, "And, as you know, your NDA will remain in place even after you leave us. If you ever have any questions about the types of information covered by that agreement, please feel free to give us a call. We'd be happy to help you sort it out." Organizations should also carefully think through when they revoke access to information and systems. In the case of a voluntary separation, this is usually easy and the employee's access is revoked at the end of their last day of employment. In the case of an involuntary separation, things may get a little trickier. If the employee is being terminated immediately, the likelihood of a revenge attack becomes higher. In those cases, organizations should cut off access at the same time as the employee is being notified of the termination. If you cut off access too early, you run the risk of alerting the employee to the firing in advance. If you do it too late, the employee may gain access to systems after they're terminated. Finally, don't forget to retrieve all of the organization's property in the employee's possession. This includes keys, access badges, laptops and mobile devices, and paper and electronic files. If you don't retrieve assets on the last day of employment, your likelihood of ever retrieving them is fairly low.
