# Security in the hiring process
========================

- From a security perspective, hiring a new employee is one of the most important decisions that an organization can make. The insider threat is real. An organization's employees have privileged access to all kinds of sensitive information and systems. Now, of course, it's impossible to filter out all of the bad apples, but organizations have a responsibility to ensure that security plays a prominent role in the hiring process. Spending a little extra time on security issues before hiring an employee can avoid costly mistakes down the road. Every organization should perform preemployment screening to verify the backgrounds of potential hires. The timing and contents of this screening will vary based upon the type of organization and legal constraints in the specific state or country where the employee is hired. Some common components of preemployment screening include checking for a criminal background in all jurisdictions where the employee has lived or worked, verifying that an employee is not listed on a sex offender registry, and that this is often a mandatory part of preemployment screening for positions where the employee will work with children, such as in a school or childcare facility. The background screening process should also include checking references provided by the employee as well as using personal contacts at past employers to learn more about a candidate, verifying that the educational and employment experience on a resume is accurate by contacting schools and employers. And in some cases, organizations may perform credit checks to further investigate an employee's background, although obtaining and using this information requires written consent and is heavily regulated, so many organizations skip this portion of background checks. Organizations should use written employment agreements that spell out the employee's responsibilities in many different areas. For the purposes of the exam, you should know that this may include security-related responsibilities. Two specific areas that should be included in all employment agreements are nondisclosure agreements, or NDAs, where the employee agrees not to disclose any confidential information learned during the course of employment, even after they leave the organization, and asset return agreements where the employee agrees to return all of the organization's property at the end of employment, including both information and physical assets. Employers should use the hiring and orientation process as an opportunity to familiarize employees with the organization's security policies through training, and perhaps obtain a written acknowledgement from each new hire that they have read and agreed to the organization's security policies. In cases where the organization is subject to compliance requirements, they should include specific training on those requirements in the orientation program. Organizations often rely upon outside vendors, consultants, and contractors to supply products and services. When these outside team members will come into contact with sensitive information and resources, the organization should ensure that they're subject to a rigorous personnel security program. Also, don't forget that internal employee transfers may create security concerns as well. When an employee moves into a new role, make sure that they've received the appropriate onboarding for that new role and that their old privileges have been properly revoked.
