# Employee privacy
========================

![img](/img/1-6-4-1.png)

During the course of employment, organizations gather all kinds of sensitive information about their employees. Much of this information employees would normally prefer be kept private. This includes the results of preemployment background checks, credit checks, and other screenings; Social Security numbers collected for tax purposes; salary and other payroll information; health information, and other benefit records. Organizations have both a legal and ethical responsibility to protect this information from prying eyes and ensure that it is not lost or stolen. Employees trust their employers to preserve their privacy, and there are many ways that an organization can meet this responsibility. These responsibilities should be documented in the organization's privacy policies. First is the principle of minimization. Organizations should collect only the information that they need in the legitimate course of employment, and they should store that information only as long as it remains necessary for a valid business reason. Second, organizations should limit access to sensitive information to those with a valid need-to-know. For example, an organization might require Social Security numbers for tax reporting purposes, but only employees directly involved in those tax processes should have access to those SSNs. Even then, access should be limited to the smallest possible number of employees. Finally, organizations should use encryption and masking whenever possible. Encrypting records prevents them from being accessed outside of normal channels, such as by someone who gains access to a hard drive or a stolen laptop. Masking data allows it to be used for identification purposes without exposing sensitive records. For example, an organization can replace portions of sensitive data such as credit card numbers with Xs to obscure it.
