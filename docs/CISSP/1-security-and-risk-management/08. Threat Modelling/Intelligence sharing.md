# Intelligence sharing
========================

![img](/img/1-8-2-1.png)

You just learned about some of the technology used to share threat intelligence information between systems in your organization. These included TAXII, STIX, and CybOX. these technologies really shine when you're able to use them to share information with your peers, in other groups within your organization, and at other organizations. Take a moment to think about the different business functions that would benefit from threat intelligence information within your own organization. You may have a variety of supported functions where threat intelligence sharing would add value, such as incident response teams who are tasked with actively responding to security incidents, vulnerability management teams who must identify potential weaknesses that could lead to future incidents, risk management teams who must understand the big picture of cybersecurity risk, security engineering teams who must design controls to combat emerging threats, and detection and monitoring teams, such as the security operations center, who are responsible for actively monitoring the security environment for threat indicators. Technology frameworks for threat intelligence allow the automated sharing of information between the tools and systems used by each of these functions. Information becomes even more powerful when shared in a collaborative manner across different organizations. To facilitate this work, information sharing and analysis centers, or ISACs, bring together cybersecurity teams from competing organizations to help share industry-specific security information in a confidential manner. The goal of the ISACs is to gather and disseminate threat intelligence without jeopardizing anonymity. It's a safe way for competitors to cooperate. Here's a listing of the various ISACs that exists. As you look through it, you'll see that there are many crossing very different industries. There's an automotive ISAC, and aviation, communications ISAC. There's one for the defense sector. Even ones as specific as covering natural gas and elections. Almost every industry has at least one ISAC that covers its operations. ISACs are usually non-profit organizations and, as such, are quite cost-effective. If you're active in cybersecurity, you should seek out the ISAC for your industry and join their information sharing efforts.
