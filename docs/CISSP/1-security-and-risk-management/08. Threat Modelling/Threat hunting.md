# Threat hunting
========================

The cybersecurity threat landscape has shifted significantly over the past few years. Those of us who have been around the security field for awhile, remember the days when we saw our primary role as building solid defenses that would prevent cyber intrusions from happening in the first place. Today, we'd consider it naive to believe that we could prevent every possible type of attack from occurring. We know that today's threat landscape includes sophisticated attackers who have the resources and time available to bypass many of the security controls that we put in place to defend our organizations. Our base assumption has necessarily changed. Instead of thinking that we can defend against every possible attack, we now take a view known as the assumption of compromise. If we accept it as a given that attackers may have already established a foothold on our networks, we now have the responsibility to search out and eliminate those compromises. That's where threat hunting comes into play. Threat hunting is an organized systematic approach to seeking out indicators of compromise on our networks. Threat hunters use a combination of time tested security techniques and new predictive analytics technology to track down signs of suspicious activity and conduct thorough investigations. Google trends shows us how interest in threat hunting grew rapidly. We didn't really see a lot of searches for the term threat hunting before 2016 but then Google searches took off quickly as organizations adopted this new approach. When we begin a threat hunting endeavor, we need to shift our mindset from a defense focused way of thinking to an offense focused approach. We need to think like the attackers who target our systems. When we conduct threat hunting, the first thing that we need to do is establish a hypothesis. That simply saying to ourselves here's a way that an attacker might get into our organization. We might establish our hypothesis based upon profiling of threat actors and their activities based on threat feeds or even on vulnerability advisories or bulletins. In some cases we might conduct intelligence fusion that brings many of these diverse sources together. Once we've established our hypothesis we think of the indicators of compromise that might be associated with that hypothesis. These indicators could be anything unusual. For example, they might include unusual binary files stored on a system, including those with known malicious content, unknown content or unexpected modifications. Or an indicator might be an unexpected process running on a system or the unusual consumption of resources by a system process. Or we might find the presence of unexpected accounts within systems and applications or unusual permissions assigned to those accounts. We might find deviations in network traffic patterns, unexplained log entries or configuration changes made the systems, applications and devices that don't correspond with our change tracking process. Searching for these indicators is the core work of threat hunting. We can improve our detection capabilities by integrating our own threat intelligence efforts with third party threat intelligence products and data collected by our SIM. It's also helpful if we can bundle critical assets in our analysis tools to help us quickly highlight indicators that appear on our most important systems. Once we discover indicators that appear to show a compromise, we can then move into our standard incident response process. We look for signs of how the attacker might have maneuvered through our network and we begin the process of containment, eradication and recovery.
