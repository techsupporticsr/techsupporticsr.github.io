# Identifying threats
========================

![img](/img/1-8-3-1.png)

Organizations face many different kinds of threat and it's often difficult to keep track of all these threats and identify those that pose the greatest risk. Security professionals use threat modeling techniques to identify and prioritize threats and assist in the implementation of security controls. When identifying potential threats to an organization, security professionals should use a structured approach. Don't just sit down and start thinking of all of the things that could go wrong. It's too easy to leave things out with this type of haphazard approach to threat identification. Instead, conduct a structured walkthrough of the potential threats to information and systems. Let's look at three ways that an organization can use a structured approach to threat identification. First, an organization can use an asset focused approach. In this approach, analysts use the organizations asset inventory as the basis for their analysis and walk through asset by asset, identifying the potential threats to that asset. For example, when they get to the organization's web presence, they might identify the severing of a single fiber optic cable as a threat to the continued availability of the website. Second, an organization can use a threat focused approach. Using this method, the organization thinks of all of the possible threats out there and then thinks through how those threats might affect different organizational information systems. For example, they might list the threat of a hacker and then think through all the ways that a hacker might try to gain access to their network. Threats to an organization may include a wide spectrum of groups, ranging from known adversaries to contractors, trusted partners, and even rogue employees. This approach seeks to understand the capability of our adversary. Finally, an organization can use a service focused approach. This is most commonly used by service providers who offer services over the internet to other organizations. For example, an organization that exposes an API to the public might think through all the interfaces offered by that API and the threats that could affect each interface. The identification of all the threats facing an organization is the first step in the threat modeling process.
