# Compliance training
========================

We develop cybersecurity programs for the purpose of safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our information, but we also face external requirements to build and implement some security controls. Compliance programs ensure that our organization's security controls are also consistent with the variety of laws, regulations, and standards that govern our organization. There are many different compliance obligations facing modern enterprises. And these differ depending upon the geographic location of the organization and its industry. A university in the United States has far different compliance requirements than a retailer in Europe. Both may have a significant compliance burden, but the details will vary. Security training program should include coverage of the specific compliance obligations facing your organization as well as the responsibilities of individual employees to ensure continued compliance. For example, if employees must never write down credit card numbers, your security awareness program should educate them about this fact. There are three different types of compliance obligations that should be covered in an organization security training program. Laws are requirements passed by a governmental authority at the national or local level. They come with civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply. For example, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act or GLBA affects security practices of financial institutions in the United States. GLBA requires that financial institutions designate an information security officer and build a formal information security program to protect customer financial information. Regulations are also mandatory requirements that an organization must follow, but they are not embodied in legislation. Some regulations come from government agencies carrying out other laws. The HIPAA security rule is a great example of this. It describes how the US government expects healthcare providers will comply with HIPAA. While HIPAA is a law, the security rule is a government regulation. Other regulations come from non-governmental authorities. For example, a contract between two organizations might include detailed security requirements and include financial penalties for non-compliance. Standards are detailed technical specifications for security and other controls. Organizations may be required to comply with standards by contractor regulation. For example, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard or PCI DSS is a standard that merchants handling credit card information must follow due to language in their contracts with credit card merchant banks. The good news is that these laws, regulations, and standards often just formalize security best practices that an organization should already be following. The best way to begin a compliance effort is to conduct a gap analysis that determines the areas where an organization may need to beef up its controls to become compliant.
