# User habits
========================

![img](/img/1-10-3-1.png)

Security education program should include a wide variety of topics related to user habits. By replacing risky habits with strong security habits, organizations reduce the likelihood that user accounts will become compromised. Let's take a look at some of the habits that security education program should address. Security training should include coverage of password security practices. Most organizations already have a password security policy that enforces requirements, such as password complexity and encryption. Security training programs should remind users of these requirements and also educate them about the importance of requirements that can't be enforced technically. For example, users should know that reusing their work password on websites and other accounts, jeopardizes security in the event that an external website is compromised. Organizations should also include data handling procedures in their security training programs. Users must know the proper ways to store, transmit, and destroy sensitive information. For example, the training may include coverage of an organization's clean desk policy designed to protect sensitive information from being left out in the open unattended. These programs are also a good opportunity to remind users of the terms of the nondisclosure agreements that they signed during their onboarding process and their ongoing obligations to protect confidential information. Security awareness efforts should also include physical security controls. If the organization uses badges or other technology to control access at doors, users should understand the importance of preventing tailgating and requiring each user to individually swipe their badge to unlock the door. Users should also learn about an organization's bring your own device policies during the security education program. If the organization does allow the use of personal devices, the training program should include coverage of acceptable use and security requirements. If the organization doesn't allow the use of personal devices with organizational data, the training program should make that clear. During your security training, you should remind users that the contents of your organization's acceptable use policy. They should know what use of IT resources is allowed and what is prohibited. For example, are they allowed to access personal email accounts, social networking sites, or file sharing sites from company computers and networks? The training should also cover the adverse actions that the organization might take if an employee violates the acceptable use policy. Finally, security education program should also include coverage of the acceptable use of social media and peer to peer networks. Users should understand their responsibilities for projecting the proper image on public facing networks and the security risks associated with exchanging links and files with unknown individuals. They should also know what measures the organization takes to perform analysis of social media use. Now that's a lot of material to cover in a security education program, but helping users adopt good security habits now may prevent serious security incidents down the road.
