# Measuring compliance and security posture
========================

Security training is an important component of any organization's information security program. If employees don't know their security responsibilities, you can't depend upon them to do their part to protect information. It's important that organizations take steps to measure the effectiveness of their security education efforts. Earlier, we looked at one way to measure security awareness through the use of simulated phishing campaigns. This really is a great way to measure the effectiveness of anti-phishing education programs, but you don't need to go to this great length to measure the effectiveness of your overall security awareness efforts. Measuring efforts don't need to be complicated. One easy way to measure the effectiveness of your program is to simply ask users how they feel about security education in a survey. You might just ask them, "How well do you think our organization "prepares you to deal with cybersecurity threats?" Or "Do you know your information security responsibilities?" You can measure how well you're educating users about incident response practices by asking, "Do you know where to report a security incident?" These survey based measures give you a good perspective on how well-prepared your workforce is to deal with cybersecurity issues. This approach to measuring security is most effective if you look at how it changes over time. You might insert a few security related questions into a quarterly employee survey and then watch how the answers change as you try different security awareness and training initiatives. You should use the results of security awareness surveys to help select new training and awareness tools, as well as tailor the message to answer changing user questions. The metrics you collect on security awareness should compliment other security metrics initiatives designed to rate your security and compliance posture.
