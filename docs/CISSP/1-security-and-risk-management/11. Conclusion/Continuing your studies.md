# Continuing your studies
========================

![img](/img/intro.png)

Thanks for watching my CISSP Security and Risk Management course. It's been a pleasure joining you for this journey through the world of information security and risk management practices. I hope that as you've completed this course, you found it interesting and helpful in preparing for the CISSP exam. You should now have a solid foundation for the security and risk management domain of the test. If you're following my CISSP course series in order, you've now finished the first domain and you're ready to move on to domain two. You can now turn to the CISSP Asset Security course. Good luck as you continue with your test preparation.
