# Confidentiality
========================

![img](/img/1-1-2-1.png)

Throughout this course, you'll learn about many different controls that information security professionals use to achieve their goals. Each of these controls is aligned with at least one of the three key objectives of cybersecurity, confidentiality, integrity or availability. What are the things you might need to do on the exam is match security controls with their corresponding goals. Let's take a look at some of the controls that security professionals use to enhance confidentiality. One way that we protect the confidentiality of information is preventing people from accessing sensitive information in the first place. Access controls are their primary mechanism for restricting people from seeing data that they shouldn't see. Access controls protect confidentiality by limiting users to accessing only those files where they have been granted permission. You'll learn more about access controls in the course covering CSP domain five, identity and access management. In that course, you'll learn how to use the Windows NTFS file access controls that are linked with active directory to restrict file and folder access to individual users and groups that require those type of access. Also in that course, you'll learn how Linux file permissions achieve the same goal, as administrators manipulate the permissions for a files user owner, group owner and other users by editing Linux permission strings. Encryption is also an important security control for enforcing confidentiality. Attackers may try to steal information without going through normal channels. For example, they might attempt to eavesdrop on network communications or remove data from a hard drive by bypassing the operating system and its access controls. Encryption uses mathematical algorithms to transform plain text into cipher text. And this cipher text is unintelligible to anyone who doesn't have the appropriate decryption key. Encryption is a really important topic on the exam and you'll learn more about it in the course covering CSP domain three, security architecture and engineering. Information can also be hidden in plain sight to protect it. Steganography is a technique that hides information inside of other files by subtly manipulating the contents of that file. For example, steganography might be used to embed a secret message within an image file that's undetectable to the naked eye.
