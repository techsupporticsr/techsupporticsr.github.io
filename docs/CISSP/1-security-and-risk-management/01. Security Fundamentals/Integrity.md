# Integrity
========================

![img](/img/1-1-3-1.png)

 Information security professionals must also apply controls to protect the integrity of information. As the second leg of the CIA triad, integrity controls ensure that information is not altered without authorization. Integrity controls protect an organization's information from accidental or intentional tampering that may come as the result of many different issues. Potential integrity failures may result from the intentional alteration of information, such as an employee altering their own salary, or a student altering their grades. They may also come from user error, such as a data entry clerk accidentally entering the wrong information in a field. Or from software or hardware error, such as an application malfunctioning and writing erroneous data to a database. Integrity failures may also come from acts of nature, such as a lightning strike that alters information stored on a disc. Hashing is one of the core controls used to protect integrity. A hash function is a mathematical algorithm that computes a unique digest for a file of any length. This digest is like a fingerprint for the file. It's a short piece of data that can uniquely identify the contents of a file and tell if they've been modified. Hashes can easily detect changes in a file. You can compute the hash value of a file today, and then compare it to the hash value you compute for that same file tomorrow. If the hash value hasn't changed, the file hasn't been modified. If the two hashes are different, you know that the file has changed. Hashes are the foundation for many different integrity controls. One of those is digital signatures, a control that helps achieve two different goals, authenticity, and non-repudiation. Authenticity is the ability of one person to prove to another person that the message they sent was received intact. If you imagine Alice sending a message to Bob, authenticity says that Bob should be able to know confidently that the message actually came from Alice. Non-repudiation goes a step further. This means that the creator of text can't later dispute that they were the real originator. In the case of Alice sending that message to Bob, non-repudiation means that Bob can not only be confident that the message is authentic, but Bob can also prove the authenticity of that message to a third party. To create a digital signature, the person signing a document first uses a hash function to create a digest of the message. They then encrypt that hash value using their private encryption key. The recipient of a digitally signed message can then use the sender's public key to decrypt the signature, and also compute the hash value of the message themselves. They then compare those two hash values. If they match, the message is authentic. Now there's a bit more technology behind this that I'll cover in the CISSP Security Architecture and Engineering Course. Digital signatures can also be used to create digital certificates. Digital certificates are files used to provide a system or individuals public encryption key to previously unknown third parties. Organizations known as certificate authorities create these certificates, and then they digitally sign them to show that they're authentic. Again, I'll cover this topic in more detail in the CISSP Security Architecture and Engineering course.
