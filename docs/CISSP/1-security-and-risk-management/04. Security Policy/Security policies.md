# Security policies
========================

![img](/img/1-4-2-1.png)

Policy is form the foundation of any information security program, and having strong data security policies is a critical component of your efforts to protect information. Data security policies and procedures play several important roles in an organization. No matter what specific issue a policy or procedure covers it should meet several key criteria. Policies provide the foundational authority for data security efforts, adding legitimacy to your work and providing a hammer, if needed, to ensure compliance. They also offer clear expectations to everyone involved in data security by explaining what data must be protected and the controls that should be used to protect that data. Policies provide guidance on the appropriate paths to follow when requesting access to data for business purposes, and they should offer an exception process for formally requesting policy exceptions when necessary to meet business requirements. Let's take a look at a few of the key issues that your data security policy should cover following the principles that I just described data storage is a key component of a security policy. Data storage policies should explain to users appropriate storage locations for data of varying classification levels. For example, a policy might restrict the use of cloud storage solutions for highly sensitive information. They should also include access control requirements for stored information, including the process used to gain access to data and the mechanisms used to enforce access controls. Policies should provide encryption the requirements for information at different classification levels and in different storage environments. For example, an organization might allow the unencrypted storage of information on hard drives located in their own data center, but might require encryption for all other storage locations, such as cloud services or employee laptops. Data transmission policies protect data in motion. Data is especially vulnerable when it's being transmitted over a network because it's susceptible to eavesdropping attacks. Therefore, data transmission policies should cover what data maybe transmitted over different kinds of networks and under what authority. They should also describe the use of encryption to protect information in transit on public and private networks, and appropriate transmission locations for sensitive information, such as the types of information that may leave corporate networks without special permission. Finally, data lifecycle policies provide important guidance concerning the end of life process for information. This is important because information may retain sensitivity even after the organization no longer requires it. Data lifecycle policy should request at least two important issues. First, data retention policy should describe how long an organization will keep different data elements. This may include a minimum retention period, such as retaining all tax related records for seven years. It may also include a maximum retention period, stating, for example, that customer credit card information should only be retained for the length of time to complete a transaction. Data retention policies limit an organization's risk exposure by ensuring the data is kept for as long as it is needed but no longer. These policies affect hardware and personnel and should apply equally to electronic and paper records. Data retention policy should also cover proper disposal of data, including the wiping techniques used to securely erase hard drives, flash drives, and other storage media before they're thrown away, recycled, or otherwise discarded. This is extremely important because of data remnants issues. Simply deleting files or formatting a hard disk is not sufficient to remove all traces of data from a device. Security administrators should use specialized tools to securely wipe storage devices and prevent the future retrieval of information believed to be deleted. In the world of cloud computing, security policies take on special importance. Policies, guidelines, and standards should provide users with clear guidance on what information may be stored and processed in the cloud. These policies should also clearly describe the process that the organization will follow when choosing to review and approve a new cloud service for use.
