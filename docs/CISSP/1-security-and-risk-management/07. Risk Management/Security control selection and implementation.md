# Security control selection and implementation
========================

![img](/img/1-7-4-1.png)

Security professionals spend the majority of their time designing, implementing, and managing security controls as countermeasures to the risks that they identify during risk assessments. Security controls are procedures and mechanisms that an organization puts in place to address security risks in some manner. This might include trying to reduce the likelihood of a risk materializing, minimize the impact of the risk if it does occur, or detect security issues that take place. Before we move into the area of cybersecurity, let's think for a moment about the way that you secure your home. You probably use a variety of different security controls. You certainly have locks on your doors and windows designed to keep out intruders, minimizing the risk of a burglary. That's just common sense. You might also have a burglar alarm designed to detect intrusions, security cameras to record activity inside your home, automatic light switches to deter a burglar by simulating human activity, and any number of other controls. In fact, even asking your neighbor to bring in your mail while you're away is an example of a security control. Some of these controls are designed to achieve the same purpose, or in the language of security professionals, the same control objective. For example, both a burglar alarm and security cameras are designed to detect intruders. We sometimes use more than one control to achieve the same objective because we want to be sure that we remain secure even if one control fails. If a burglar manages to open a window without tripping the burglar alarm, they may still be caught on your security cameras. This is known as the defense in depth principle, applying multiple overlapping controls to achieve the same objective. Security professionals use a variety of different categories to group similar security controls. We'll talk about two different ways that they do this. First, we'll discuss grouping controls by their purpose, whether they're designed to prevent, detect, or correct security issues. Then we'll discuss grouping them by their mechanism of action, the way that they work. This group's controls into the categories of technical, management, and operational controls. Preventative controls are designed to stop a security issue from occurring in the first place. A firewall that blocks unwanted network traffic is an example of a preventive control. Detective controls identify potential security breaches that require further investigation. An intrusion detection system that searches for signs of network breaches is an example of a detective control. Corrective controls remediate security issues that have already occurred. If an attacker breaks into a system and wipes out critical information, restoring that information from backup is an example of a corrective control. The second way that we can categorize controls is by their mechanism of action. This group's controls is either technical, operational, or management controls. Technical controls are exactly what the name implies, the use of technology to achieve security objectives. Think about all of the components of an IT infrastructure that perform security functions. Firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, encryption, data loss prevention, and antivirus software are all examples of technical security controls. Operational controls include the processes that we put in place to manage technology in a secure manner. These operational controls include many of the tasks that security professionals carry out every day, such as user access reviews, log monitoring, background checks, and security awareness training. It's sometimes tricky to tell the difference between technical and operational controls. If you get an exam question on this topic, one trick is to remember that operational controls are carried out by individuals, while technical controls are carried out by technology. For example, a firewall enforcing rules is a technical control, while a system administrator reviewing firewall logs is an operational control. Management controls are focused on the mechanics of the risk management process. One common management control is conducting regular risk assessments to identify the threats, vulnerabilities, and risks facing an organization or a specific information system. Other management controls include conducting regular security planning and including security considerations in an organization's change management, service acquisition, and project management methodologies. Now, of course, there's no such thing as a perfect control. That's why we follow the defense in depth principle. We need to design our security controls so the organization remains secure even if a control fails. There are two main ways that a control can fail. First, a false positive error occurs when a control triggers in a situation where it shouldn't trigger. For example, a false positive occurs when a detective control such as an intrusion detection system reports a security issue where there isn't any issue present. False positives can be dangerous because they reduce the confidence that security administrators have in the control, and they sometimes lead to administrators ignoring future alerts from the same system. False negative errors occur when a control fails to trigger in a situation where it should. Thinking about that intrusion detection system again, a false negative occurs if an actual security incident takes place and the system fails to detect that incident, giving administrators a false sense of safety.
