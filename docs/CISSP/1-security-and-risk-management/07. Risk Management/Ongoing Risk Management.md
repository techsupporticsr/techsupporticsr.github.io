 Implementing security controls is only the beginning of the risk management journey. Security professionals must perform a variety of ongoing activities to ensure that risks remain properly managed. These include monitoring and assessing controls, measuring control effectiveness, reporting, and continuous improvement. Risk control assessments represent a point in time analysis of the risks facing an organization, and the ability of controls to manage those risks properly. These assessments may be completed as self-assessments by an internal security team, or as external assessments by a consultant or auditor. The risk environment changes on a regular basis, and organizations should routinely review their risk assessments and perform periodic control assessments designed to test the correct functioning and effectiveness of these controls. For example, most organizations use a firewall to block unwanted network traffic. A control assessment of the firewall might use network scanning tools to verify that it is not allowing any unwanted traffic through the network perimeter. Organizations should conduct routine assessments of the effectiveness of their security and privacy controls, and use this information to inform management reporting. These routine activities should include both technical control reviews and operational control reviews. For example, an organization might track the number of compromised end user accounts as a means to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-phishing controls. They might also track the number of vulnerabilities detected in public-facing systems as a means to evaluate the effectiveness of operating system and application patching. Organizations seeking to assess the security knowledge and skills of software developers might use the number of critical findings in initial scans of new applications. And organizations might use the number of data breaches requiring notification of individuals as a measure of the overall effectiveness of their security program. All of these measures provide valuable information to management as they seek to refine their information security programs. The Risk Maturity Model, or RMM, is a framework created by the Risk Management Society to help organizations assess the state of their risk management programs. RMM looks at a series of over 70 risk management indicators and helps an organization determine where it stands on the Risk Maturity Model by assigning it a level ranging from one through five. The least mature organizations are described as using Ad hoc practices, and then they can advance through the stages of Initial, Repeatable, Managed, and Leadership. All security programs should embrace a spirit of continuous improvement that seeks to enhance controls and improve the overall state of information security in the organization over time. The results of control effectiveness measures, risk assessments, and expert knowledge should feed this improvement process.
