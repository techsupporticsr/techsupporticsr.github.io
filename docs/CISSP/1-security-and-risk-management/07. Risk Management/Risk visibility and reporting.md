Cybersecurity teams have a wide variety of risk identification, assessment and management tools at their disposal. You've already learned about many of them in this course. Risk visibility and reporting techniques ensure that the results of these risk management processes are clearly documented and tracked over time. The core tool that most organizations use for maintaining ongoing visibility into risks is a risk register. The risk register is a centralized document that tracks information about the nature and status of each risk facing the organization. Risk registers may be used on an organization-wide basis, or they may be used to track the risks associated with a single project or a subject domain. In some cases, risk registers may be referred to as risk logs. Risk registers vary from organization to organization but they typically contain the following types of information. A description of each risk. A categorization scheme used to group the risks into similar segments. The results of a risk assessment including the probability and impact of the risk. And a risk rating calculated by multiplying the probability and impact scores. The risk register may also include actions taken to manage a risk including specific risk mitigation steps that are either completed or in progress. Here's an example of a risk register that I helped develop with a group called EDUCAUSE. It's a tool used to help higher education IT organizations manage high-level technology risks facing their institutions. It includes quite a few risk statements covering many different domains of technology and the different types of risks that the organization may face. For example, this risk here in number 17 says that information technology communications and networks might not be protected from complete or intermittent failure. It goes on to explain some possible causes of that risk and the impact that it might have on the organization. And then it provides institutions with the ability to rate that risk based on its likelihood and impact. So for example, if I think this is a likely risk I might assign it a value of three for high. And if it would have a moderate impact on the organization, I might give it a value of two. Then we have a risk score computed by multiplying the likelihood and impact together, and we see that three times two is six. That's just one example of a risk register, one the many IT risks facing an organization. Every organization should develop its own register maybe based on some of these common templates, but identifying the specific risks facing their organization. When developing that risk register, the organization has many sources of information available to help populate the register with risks. These include the results of formal risk assessments conducted by the organization, audit findings identified by internal and external auditors, risks identified by members of the IT or planning team and threat intelligence contributed by third parties. Threat intelligence is playing an increasingly important role in many organizations' efforts to maintain visibility into the risks that they face. By sharing threat intelligence, organizations may pool their knowledge to help combat external threats, either by purchasing a threat intelligence service from a vendor or by joining a threat intelligence sharing consortium. Threat intelligence sharing efforts provide an anonymized way for organizations to communicate with each other about the nature and characteristics of attacks that they may experience. Threat intelligence information may be used to monitor risk trends in a general way, or it may be used operationally to create, for example, a black list of IP addresses known to be the source of attacks. Today's cybersecurity environment is complex with many different risks facing the organization. The use of risk registers, threat intelligence and similar solutions helps organizations maintain visibility into these risks as they seek to manage them. Now the risk register is a lengthy document that often provides too much detail for business leaders. When communicating risk management concepts to senior leaders, risk professionals often use a risk matrix or heat map such as the one shown here. This approach quickly summarizes risks and allows senior leaders to quickly focus on the most significant risks facing the organization.
