# Vendor agreements
========================

 One of the most important components of managing vendor relationships is ensuring that appropriate agreements are in place to ensure interoperability and require that the vendor provide a level of service consistent with the customer's expectations.
 
Non-disclosure agreements or NDAs are typically the first documents signed as two organizations explore a business partnership. 

NDAs assure the firms that they will keep each other's information confidential. As an organization begins to evaluate a new vendor relationship, it should establish service-level requirements or SLRs that describe the organization's expectations of the vendor during the relationship. 

These requirements may address any concerns that the customer has for the quality of service provided by the vendor. For example, service-level requirements may include system response time, availability of service, data preservation requirements or any other parameters specified by the customer. 

Once an organization negotiates these requirements with the vendor, it should document the results in a service-level agreement or SLA. 

The SLA is a written contract between the vendor and the customer that describes the conditions of service and the penalties the vendor will incur for failure to maintain the agreed upon service level.

There are several other vehicles available to organizations seeking to formalize relationships with vendors. A memorandum of understanding or MOU is simply a letter written to document aspects of the relationship. 

MOUs are commonly used when a legal dispute is unlikely, but the customer and vendor still wish to document their relationship to avoid future misunderstandings. 

MOUs are commonly used in cases where an internal service provider is offering a service to a customer that's in a different business unit of the same company. Business partnership agreements or BPAs exist when two organizations agree to do business with each other in a partnership. For example, if two companies jointly develop and market a product, the BPA might specify each partner's responsibilities and the division of profits. 

Interconnection security agreements or ISAs include details on the ways that two organizations will interconnect their networks, systems and/or data. The ISA provides details on connection security parameters such as the encryption standards and transfer protocols that will be used. 

In cases where the customer anticipates entering into many different projects with a vendor, they may choose to create a master service agreement or MSA, that includes all the key terms that will govern the relationship. 

Then, each time they have a new project they can complete a statement of work or SOW that includes the specific terms of that engagement. The SOW is governed by the terms of the umbrella MSA. Security and compliance are key issues during the negotiation of agreements with vendors. As the organization develops service level requirements, it should include minimum security requirements in the agreement. For example, the customer might state that it expects all information will be encrypted both at rest and in transit using AES 256 bit encryption. As you review a proposed agreement from a security perspective, you should ensure that the agreement includes appropriate provisions that protect your organization from both security and compliance perspectives. The agreement should document all security and compliance requirements and should also allow the customer to verify compliance and performance standards through monitoring conducted either by the customer or an independent third party. Agreement should also ensure the right of the customer to audit the vendor through assessments conducted by the customer or a third party. These assessments may include onsite visits, the exchange and review of documents and the review of policies, processes and procedures. Contracts and agreements are an important part of the relationship between a customer and a vendor. 

Taking the time to clearly document an agreement avoids misunderstandings in the early stages of a relationship and protects both parties in the event of a dispute.
