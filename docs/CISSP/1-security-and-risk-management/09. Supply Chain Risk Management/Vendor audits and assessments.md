# Vendor audits and assessments
========================

Audits and assessments provide organizations with an opportunity to evaluate their security controls, to ensure that those controls are functioning properly, and that they're effectively protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information and systems. Now audits and assessments are similar in both purpose and function. Both involve evaluating security controls, reporting on their effectiveness and making recommendations for improvement. The main difference lies in the purpose of the review. Assessments are generally performed by or requested by an organization's IT staff. Audits are generally performed at the request of someone else, such as a regulator, executive or board of directors. When an organization undergoes an audit, the auditors follow a formal standard and perform planned tests that are designed to determine how well the organization complies with the standard. No matter what type of audit or assessment is taking place, the engagement should always begin with a planning process that clearly outlines the scope of the engagement, the timeline for completion and the expected deliverables. Doing this planning upfront, reduces the likelihood of misunderstandings down the road. For example, let's take a look at the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard PCI DSS. PCI DSS is a very long and detailed standard, that contains the security requirements for merchants and service providers handling credit card information. Banks may require that organizations subject to PCI DSS, undergo an independent audit. This provides the bank with the assurance that an outside organization has come in and verified that the company is properly controlling credit card information. When the auditors arrive, they pull out this document, the audit procedures for PCI DSS. Now this is a 139 page document that contains very detailed instructions for both the merchants and the auditor. Let's take a look at an example here on page 40. This requirement, requirement 3.4 says that merchants must render credit card numbers unreadable when they're stored using encryption, truncation, tokens or hashing. Now that's a fairly straightforward requirement that's listed here in the first column, PCI DSS requirements. The next column over is the testing procedure. This provides very detailed guidance, the auditor telling them exactly what they have to do to see if the organization complies with the requirement. In this case, there are five test procedures for this requirement. The auditor must do each of these things, and then report the results of those tests. They have to examine documentation about the system you use to protect card numbers, look at tables or files from data repositories to verify that the card numbers are unreadable, examine a sample of removable media for the same thing, then take a look at audit logs, including payment application logs to make sure the card numbers don't appear in readable form there, and then if hashed or truncated versions of the card number are present in the environment, they have to look at the controls to verify that the hashed and truncated versions can't be correlated to reconstruct card numbers. That's a lot of work and that's how it only goes, very deep tailed tests against a specific standard. Audits may be performed by two different types of entity: Internal and external auditors. Internal auditors are employed by the same organization that's being evaluated, but they don't report to the leader of the unit being audited. In many organizations, the head of internal audit reports directly to the president or chief executive. Internal auditors perform audits at the request of management or the board of directors. External auditors are independent audit firms that provide a completely independent assessment. There're hundreds of audit firms that perform this work, but the field is dominated by the so-called big four: PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young, Deloitte and Kpmg. These firms perform audits at the request of a board of directors or regulators. Every audit should have a clearly defined scope. This may be very broad, such as an IT controls audit that looks at the overall state of technology controls in the organization, or it may be extremely focused such as a credit card compliance audit. It's very important to clearly define the scope and test procedures in advance and communicate them at the beginning of the audit to both the auditors and auditees. This helps prevent unwanted surprises. Organizations should perform audits and assessments routinely and regularly. Assessments in particular, are a great way for managers to ensure that processes are working effectively over time. One particularly important assessment, is the user access review. During this review, assessors obtain a listing of all the rights and permissions granted to a user, and verify that they are implemented correctly and that there is an appropriate chain of approval for each permission setting. Audits usually include a gap analysis as a deliverable. This is almost always the case when an audit is performed against a very detailed technical standards such as PCI DSS. The gap analysis provides cybersecurity teams with a list of the controls that were missing or improperly functions. A well performed gap analysis serves as a roadmap for remediation and bringing the organization into compliance with the audit standard.
