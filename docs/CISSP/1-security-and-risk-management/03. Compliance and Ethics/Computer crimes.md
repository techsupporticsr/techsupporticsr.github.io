# Computer crimes
========================

While most of the laws related to information security fall into the categories of civil and administrative law, occasionally we cross paths with criminal law. Cases of information theft, system intrusion, identity theft, and other crimes are harmful to society and may trigger criminal sanctions. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act or CFAA is a criminal law that makes it a federal offense to engage in many types of hacking activity. Specifically, the CFAA prohibits unauthorized access to any computer system that is engaged in interstate commerce, and it prohibits the creation of malicious code that might cause damage to a computer system. Now, there are many nuances to this law, but the bottom line is that CFAA makes hacking a criminal offense punishable by fines and/or imprisonment. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act, ECPA, restricts the government interception of communications and stored information. That includes telephone calls, network transmissions, email messages, and pen registers that log records of communications. Under the ECPA, the government must meet stringent requirements before receiving a search warrant for electronic communications. Finally, the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act makes it a federal crime to steal an individual's identity. This includes using or possessing false identification and transferring or using identity information without consent, with the intent of committing fraud. Violations of this Act are punishable by 15 years of imprisonment and fines of up to $250,000.
