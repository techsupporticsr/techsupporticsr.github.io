# Intellectual property
========================

![img](/img/1-3-5-1.png)

One very important responsibility of information security professionals is protecting the intellectual property belonging to their organizations from unauthorized use or disclosure. Now, there were a series of legal mechanisms available to protect intellectual property, these include copyrights, trademarks, patents, and trade secrets. Each type of intellectual property protection covers different types of information in different ways. Copyrights protect creative works against theft. Information protected by copyright includes books, web content, magazines, and other written works as well as art music and even computer software. Copyright protection is automatically granted to the creator of rework upon that creation. Although copyright owners may choose to register their copyright with governmental authorities, this is not a legal requirement. In the United States, The Library of Congress administers the copyright program through the United States Copyright Office. The length of copyright protection varies widely according to the country of registration, the type of work, and whether the author is an individual or a corporation. In all cases, it's a very long time. For example, if you create a new creative work today, the copyright protection for that work lasts for 70 years beyond your death. Once a copyright expires work moves into the public domain and it may be used freely by anyone without requiring licensing or permission. Copyrights are denoted by using the circle C symbol shown here. Trademarks are used to protect the words and symbols you use to identify products and services. Information protected by trademark includes brand names, logos, and slogans. The owners of trademarks must register their trademarks with the government to achieve full protection. In the United States, this is handled through the US Patent and Trademark Office a division of the department of commerce. Trademarks may last indefinitely, but there registrations must be renewed every 10 years. There were only valid as long as they are being actively used. If an organization stops using a trademark in commerce, they are said to have abandoned the trademark after five years of non-use. Trademarks are denoted using the superscript TM symbol shown here. Once they're granted registration status by the government, they may be denoted using the circle R symbol. Patents protect inventions, providing the inventor with the exclusive use of their invention for a period of time. The purpose of patents is to stimulate invention by ensuring and ventures that others will not simply copy their ideas in the marketplace. In order to be granted a patent, an inventor must demonstrate that their idea meets three criteria. First, it must be novel, meaning that it's a new idea that nobody's thought of in the past. Second, it must be useful, meaning that it provides some benefit to someone and that is actually possible to use the invention. And finally, it must be non-obvious, meaning that there was some inventive work involved. Once granted a patent generally lasts for 20 years beyond the filing date, but this may be extended if there are governmental delays in issuing the patents. One of the major drawbacks of patents is that they require public disclosure of the invention in the patent application. The inventor must clearly describe to the world what their invention is and how it works. When the patent protection expires anyone is then free to use the invention. In cases where an inventor doesn't want to make the invention public the organization may choose to pursue trade secret protection. With a trade secret, the owner simply doesn't tell anyone about the invention and keeps the details secret. As long as the organization is able to protect that secret, it enjoys exclusive use of the invention. The downside is that if someone else discovers how the invention works, they are free to use it.
