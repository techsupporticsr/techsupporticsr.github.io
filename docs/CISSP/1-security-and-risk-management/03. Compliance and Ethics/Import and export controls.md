# Import and export controls
========================

![img](/img/1-3-6-1.png)

Many countries have requirements about the types of information and goods that may cross international borders. In the United States, the government uses a category of regulations known as export controls to restrict the flow of goods and information considered sensitive for military and scientific purposes. These rules come in several different forms. The International Trafficking and Arms Regulations or ITAR applies to anything that the government considers a defense article. This includes many of the things that you would expect to be classified as munitions, firearms, tanks, submarines, and nuclear weapons, but it also includes the technical data associated with military programs. Government contractors, researchers, and others who come into contact with this information must protect it from unauthorized export. The Export Administration Regulations or EAR apply to technology and information that's considered dual use, meaning that it has both military and commercial purposes. EAR covers many broad categories of technology, including sensitive electronics and computers, lasers, navigation, marine technology, and more. The Office of Foreign Assets Control or OFAC restricts economic transactions with countries that are considered sponsors of terrorism, narcotics, or other activities considered contrary to the foreign policy of the United States. Information security professionals must be aware of the various import and export controls that apply to their industry and ensure that their activities remain compliant with these regulations.
