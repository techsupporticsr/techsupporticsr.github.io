# Data privacy
========================

![img](/img/1-3-2-1.png)

All of the stakeholders in a data governance program bear responsibility for protecting the privacy of personal information under their care throughout the information lifecycle. Now, this private information may come in many forms. Two of the most common elements of private information are personally identifiable information, or PII, and protected health information, or PHI. PII includes all information that can be tied back to a specific individual, while PHI includes healthcare records that are regulated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, HIPAA. The generally accepted privacy principles, or GAPP, are 10 components of data privacy that can be used to help organizations design their own privacy programs. The GAPP principles were developed through collaboration between four major industry organizations: The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Information Systems Audit and Control Association and the Institute of Internal Auditors. The first of the 10 GAPP principles is management. This principle states that an organization handling private information should have policies, procedures and governance structures in place to protect privacy. For example, the organization should clearly define the roles of data owner, data steward and data custodian. The second GAPP principle is notice. Anyone who is the subject of records maintained by the organization should receive notice of that fact, as well as access to the privacy policies and procedures followed by the organization. This is often accomplished through the terms of agreement for a website and a formal privacy notice. The third GAPP principle is choice and consent. The organization should inform data subjects of their options regarding the data they own and get consent from those individuals for the collection, storage, use and sharing of that information. The fourth GAPP principle is collection. The organization should only collect personal information for purposes disclosed in their privacy notices. The fifth principle is use, retention and disposal. When the organization collects personal information, it should only use it for disclosed purposes and not use it for other reasons just because they already have the data. Additionally, the organization should dispose of the data securely, as soon as it is no longer needed for the disclosed purpose. The sixth GAPP principle is access. Organizations should provide data subjects with the ability to review and update their personal information. The seventh GAPP principles surrounds disclosure to third parties. The organization should only share information with third parties if that sharing is consistent with the purposes disclosed in privacy notices, and they have the consent of the individual to share that information. The eighth GAPP principle is security. The organization must secure private information against unauthorized access. The ninth GAPP principle is quality. The organization should take reasonable steps to ensure that the private information they maintain is accurate, complete and relevant. And finally, the 10th GAPP principle is monitoring and enforcement. The organization should have a program in place to monitor compliance with its privacy policies and provide a dispute resolution mechanism. Each of these 10 GAPP principles plays an important role in developing a comprehensive information privacy program. Data owners should ensure that they are followed for each element of personal information under their control. If you're looking for more detailed control objectives, the International Organization for Standardization offers ISO Standard 27018. This standard provides a code of practice for the protection of personally identifiable information in public cloud environments. Organizations developing and monitoring their privacy program should conduct regular privacy impact assessments to identify the privacy ramifications of their business operations.
