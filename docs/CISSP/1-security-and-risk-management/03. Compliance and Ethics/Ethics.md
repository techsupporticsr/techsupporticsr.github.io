# Ethics
========================

![img](/img/1-3-8-1.png)

Information security professionals are bound by codes of professional ethics to act honorably and responsibly. Many organizations have internal codes of ethics that their employees must follow. For example, here's the code of ethics for AT&T. It includes rules and guidelines for how employees should conduct themselves honestly and ethically and avoid personal conflicts of interest. ISC squared also has a code of ethics that applies to all certified security professionals. This code includes a preamble of two statements as well as four canons of the code of ethics. You'll need to know these when you take the CSP exam. The preamble to the code of ethics states that the safety and welfare of society and the common good, duty to our principals and to each other requires that we adhere and be seen to adhere to the highest ethical standards of behavior. Therefore, strict adherence to this code is a condition of certification. And then the code includes those four canons. They are that we must protect society, the common good, necessary public trust and confidence and the infrastructure. That we must act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly and legally. That we must provide diligent and competent service to principals and that we act to advance and protect the profession. Violations of the code of ethics are grounds for the revocation of an individual certification. Members of ISC squared who become aware of an ethics breach by any other member are required to report that breach to the organization for investigation.
