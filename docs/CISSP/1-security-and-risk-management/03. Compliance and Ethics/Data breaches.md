# Data breaches
========================

![img](/img/1-3-7-1.png)

Data breaches can have serious consequences for an organization. An organization suffering a data breach might experience reputational damage, become the source of identity theft incidents, suffer fines, or lose intellectual property to theft. For these reasons, the security policies of many organizations require immediate escalation to senior management of any incident that involves a breach of sensitive data. In the unfortunate event of a known or suspected data breach, information security professionals have a range of responsibilities dictated by laws and regulations. Like many other security and privacy regulations in the United States, data breach laws are a patchwork of regulations that apply in different ways. Some rules apply to specific industries, such as HIPAA for the healthcare industry, PCI DSS for the credit card industry, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for publicly traded companies. Other rules apply to specific jurisdictions such as the state-by-state data breach notification laws in the U.S. and the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. Generally speaking, these laws apply when an organization knows or suspects that it has suffered a breach of personally identifiable information, or PII. The specific definition of PII varies from state to state, but there are several elements commonly found in these laws. They often include Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers, and bank account numbers, but may extend to other information, as well. Some of the common requirements when an organization suspects a breach include notifying affected individuals, informing government agencies, and providing notice to the general public. Organizations often also offer credit monitoring services or other compensations to the victims of a data breach incident. As a security professional, you'll need to remain aware of the laws that apply in the jurisdictions where you do business. The National Conference of State Legislatures maintains a website that links to the breach notification laws of each U.S. state. One quick exam tip for you. Encryption is an easy way to protect your organization against data breaches. In fact, most breach notification laws include specific exemptions for encrypted data.
