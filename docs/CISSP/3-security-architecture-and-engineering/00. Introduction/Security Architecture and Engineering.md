# Security Architecture and Engineering
========================

![img](/img/02-00-01-01.png)



Hi, I'm Mike Chapple and I'd like to welcome you to our CISSP Security Architecture and Engineering course. 

The Certified Information Systems Security Professional, or CISSP certification, is the gold standard for information security certification. 

You'll find that it's a core requirement for many mid and senior level information security positions. Earning the CISSP requires demonstrating that you have sufficient work experience and passing an exam covering the eight domains of information security. This course covers the third of those eight domains, security architecture and engineering. 13% of the questions on the CISSP exam come from this domain. I have two decades of experience as an information security professional and I've been involved in CISSP training and certification for most of those. As we work our way through this course, we will focus on each topic covered by domain three. We'll review how to select security controls that balance business needs and security requirements. We'll also do a deep dive into cryptography, one of the most important data protection tools at the disposal of a security professional. You'll also learn about physical security topics, including site design and monitoring. And that's just a small sampling of the many topics covered in this course. These topics, combined with the information you learn in our other CISSP courses, will help you pass the CISSP exam and also provide a critical foundation for your career in information security. In addition to using this course and the companion books to prepare for the exam, I encourage you to visit my website at certmike.com and sign up for my free CISSP study group. 

I'll send you weekly emails guiding you through the exam preparation process and offer you test taking tips to get you ready for the exam. All right, let's get rolling.
