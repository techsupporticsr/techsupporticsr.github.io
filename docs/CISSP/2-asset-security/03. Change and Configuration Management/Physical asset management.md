# Physical asset management
========================

Cybersecurity teams often find themselves responsible for the physical security of technology resources. The loss and theft of these resources exposes organizations to millions of dollars of losses each year, and when those devices are lost or stolen, it's critical to understand what was on them to perform a security impact analysis. Any good physical security program must begin with an inventory process. Quite simply, you can't keep track of your hardware if you don't know what hardware you own. The hardware inventory process should be integrated with the provisioning and decommissioning processes that occur throughout the lifecycle of a piece of hardware. Most organizations accomplish this through the use of an asset management system that either stands on its own or is part of a larger IT service management platform. Let's walk through the lifecycle of a typical piece of hardware, and how the inventory might change. First, a user states a need for a new piece of hardware. Let's say that I want a new laptop. I contact my IT team, and they assist me with the order. As soon as they place the order, the IT staff member should create an inventory record to track the status of that hardware. Next, the hardware arrives on site a couple of weeks later. The receiving clerk who accepts delivery should match that hardware up with the hardware inventory record, and note that the hardware was received, adding some information to the hardware record, such as the device's serial number. The clerk then sends it on to the IT staff member, and notes in the inventory that that staff member now has possession of the device. During the receiving process, someone attaches a permanent asset tag to the device. This tag indicates that the device is property of the company, and includes a serial number. It also may incorporate an RFID chip that makes remote inventory management possible. The tag may be attached by the receiving clerk or by the IT staff member who performs the initial configuration. After configuring the device to meet my needs, the IT staff member delivers it to me and changes the record to indicate that I now have possession of the device. I use the computer happily for several years, and then eventually decide that I want to order a new device, which starts the whole process that we just described again. After I receive a new device, I give the old one to the IT staff member, who then decides to reuse it for an intern, updating the hardware inventory to note that I am no longer responsible for the device. Data is critical to a hardware inventory. As soon as someone misses an update, the data may become very inaccurate. For this reason, many asset management systems include automation technology that correlates inventory records with devices present on the network, pointing out any inconsistencies to inventory managers. Media management is a related and important task. While it's impossible to track every piece of data storage media in an organization, security teams should definitely track media that contains highly sensitive information. In most cases, the asset management system used to track hardware assets can also be used to track media assets.
