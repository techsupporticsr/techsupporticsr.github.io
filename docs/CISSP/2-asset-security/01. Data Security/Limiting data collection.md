# Limiting data collection
========================

Limiting data collection is the most important way that an organization can protect personal privacy. 

If an organization doesn't collect personal information in the first place, it can't abuse, lose or otherwise mistreat that information. Privacy principles require that organizations provide individuals with notice of the information they collect, the ways that they use it, and obtain consent of those individuals for that use. And this is just the first barrier to data collection. Organizations should never collect information that falls outside of the disclosures that they've made to individuals, even if it's easy to do so, or seems to be incidental to the approved purpose. If you do have a legitimate need to collect more information than you've disclosed, you should revise your disclosures, notifying individuals of the information that you're collecting, and how you will use it. Obtain new consent prior to collecting new information. When you do have a legitimate need to collect information, you've given notice and obtained consent. Good security and privacy practice says that you should still collect only the minimum information needed for your disclosed purposes. Don't collect more than you need and don't keep it any longer than necessary. In some cases, you may find that the technology that you use forces you to exceed this minimization principle. For example, you might be using a web server that records more information in web access logs than you need for your disclosed analysis purposes. If that's the case, you still must disclose the collection to individuals because after all you are collecting the information. The difference is that if you don't have a legitimate need to keep the information, you should remove unnecessary information as quickly as possible, preferably through an automated process that doesn't require any human intervention. The less information you have the better. You also have a responsibility to ensure that all of your data collection efforts use fair and lawful means of collection. Now interpreting what is fair and lawful depends upon your industry and the laws and ethical practices that apply to you. You should consult your attorneys and privacy officials before beginning or modifying any data collection effort. The bottom line is that you should make all of your disclosures in plain language, make your data practices transparent, and don't be dishonest or deceitful. In some cases you may obtain personal information about individuals from third parties, such as your business partners. In those cases, you should take reasonable steps to ensure that the third party collected that information in accordance with privacy principles and that they obtained proper permission to share it with you. Be up front with your users about the sources of information that you're using.
