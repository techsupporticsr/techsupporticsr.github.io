# Data security roles
========================

![img](/img/2-01-03-01.png)

Data security is a complex problem and many different people throughout the organization play a role in protecting information. Let's take a look at some of the concepts surrounding data ownership and stewardship. Data governance in many organizations follows a four tiered model of roles. At the highest level, the data owner for particular data sets is a senior level official who bears overall responsibility for that data. The data owner sets policies and guidelines around data use and data security and has the authority to make final decisions regarding a dataset. Data owners are usually the business leaders who have responsibility for the mission area most closely related to the data set. For example, an organization's vice-president for human resources might be the data owner for employment information. The European union's general data protection regulation, GDPR uses the term data controller to refer to the senior most role that many organizations call the data owner. GDPR does this to avoid giving the impression that the organization necessarily owns the data that they're using. You can think of the terms, data owner, and data controller as being quite similar. Practically speaking most individuals who are senior enough to hold the position of data owner do not have the time available to get involved in any of the nitty gritty decisions of data governance. They usually delegate that responsibility to a data steward. The data steward handles the implementation of the high level policies set by the data owner. For example, a data steward might make day-to-day decisions about who can access the data set. In the case of the employee data set that we were just talking about, if the data owner is the VP for human resources that vice president might delegate data stewardship responsibility to a director for HR information services. In most cases, there is a reporting relationship between the data owner and the data steward. Data custodians or data processors are the individuals who store and process the information in question. IT staff often find themselves in the position of data custodian because of their roles as system owners and administrators. Technologists are rarely data owners or data stewards but they are often data custodians for almost all of the data in the organization due to the nature of their jobs. They ensure that appropriate data protections are in place, including encryption, backups, access controls and other mechanisms that meet the requirements set forth by data owners and stewards. Data users are the analysts customer service representatives, managers and others in an organization who work with data on a regular basis. They interact with data regularly and must protect it from unauthorized disclosure. Data users must work within the rules set by data owners and data stewards. There's one other role that you should be familiar with as you prepare for the exam, data subjects. The data subject is the person referred to in collected data. Data subjects don't always work for the organization. So they fall outside of the four tier data governance model. But data subjects have rights that must be protected by data governance programs. In addition to security, individuals and data governance roles have a responsibility to ensure that the organization fulfills its privacy requirements. These requirements may come from legal, contractual or ethical obligations. For example, if an organization stores the social security numbers of employees, that data owners should make sure that those numbers are properly protected and only used for legitimate business purposes. Data custodians and processors must also ensure that these protections are in place and functioning properly. One last note, as you prepare for the exam, it's very important to draw a distinction between a system owner and a data owner, just because you might physically own a system does not mean that you also own all the information stored or processed on that system. This is true, both within an organization and when data is shared between organizations.
