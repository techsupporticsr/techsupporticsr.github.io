# Leveraging industry standards
========================

Security standards may contain hundreds or even thousands of individual settings that experts recommend to improve system security.
 
While these settings are important, most organizations simply don't have the resources or expertise to develop their own standards from scratch. 

Fortunately, vendors and third-party security organizations develop and create industry standards that serve as a starting point for enterprise security efforts. One of the most common sources of security standards are the vendors who create devices, applications, and operating systems. After all, they know their products better than anyone else, and they have a vested interest in helping you operate those products securely. If you have a security breach, it not only jeopardizes your organization, but also reflects poorly upon the products that you use. Here's an example of the security standards offered by Microsoft. The Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit is a set of tools that assist with system configuration and management. As you can see here, it includes security standards for windows, desktop, and server operating systems, Microsoft Office, and Microsoft Edge. This set of tools allows you to determine whether your systems comply with security policies and use active directory group policy to enforce security best practices. Some people simply don't trust that vendors will provide objective security advice, so they turn to other sources of expertise when developing security standards. The U.S government spends quite a bit of time and energy on security standards and the National Institute of Standards and Technology or NIST is an excellent source of security guidance. Here's one NIST standard. This document, NIST Special Publication, 800-179, provide security guidance for users of Apple's macOS 10.12, more commonly known as Sierra. This 116 page document goes into deep detail on Sierra's security settings. Let's take a look at an example. Here on page 27 of NIST Sierra Security Standard, we see details on how NIST recommends configuring time machine, the Mac backup software. Some organizations want an even more objective resource than the government and seek out third-party organizations that exist solely to provide security advice. One of these, the Center for Internet Security, publishes a series of security benchmarks that represent the consensus opinions of a series of subject matter experts. Here's a list of the benchmarks currently available from CIS. You can see they've been very recently updated and they cover everything from Cisco network devices to Oracle databases, different versions of the Linux operating system, the Apache web server, Microsoft Windows products. And as you scroll through, you see operating systems, applications, database servers, there's Docker containerization software, more versions of operating systems, MIT Kerberos authentication, Apple iOS for mobile devices. The way that the center for internet security decides which benchmarks they're going to develop is based upon input from the community. If there's sufficient community interest in a new baseline, they'll go ahead and work with a series of subject matter experts from the security community to develop that benchmark. These industry security benchmarks provide organizations with a great starting point for their own system configuration efforts. Beginning with a solid foundation saves countless hours of work and provides a secure starting point for an organization's customized security standards.
