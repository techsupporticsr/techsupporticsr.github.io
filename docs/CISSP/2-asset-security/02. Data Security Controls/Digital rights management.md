# Digital rights management
========================

In a knowledge-based economy, businesses go to great lengths to protect their intellectual property. 

While trademark, copyright, and patent protections do help, businesses must also ensure that they're using technical and procedural safeguards to protect their information. Information Rights Management, or IRM programs, are designed to enforce an organization's information security policy. 

They do this by achieving three objectives: enforcing data rights to keep information out of unauthorized hands, provisioning access to employees, partners, and other authorized users, and implementing access control models that enforce access policies consistently across platforms and systems. 

Digital Rights Management, or DRM software, is one of the important tools available to organizations building out their IRM programs. 

DRM provides content owners with the technical ability to prevent the unauthorized use of their content. 

DRM uses encryption technology to render content inaccessible to those who do not possess the necessary license to view the information. 

Over the years, content owners have applied this technology to music, movies, books, video games, and other electronic content. 

The most well-known example of DRM technology is the use of encryption to protect music files. 

Apple was one of the earliest adopters of DRM when they applied FairPlay DRM technology to music downloaded from the iTunes Store. 

But they later dropped this approach when Apple co-founder Steve Jobs made a very public statement that said in part, "If the big four music companies would license Apple their music without the requirement that it be protected with DRM, we would switch to selling only DRM-free music on our iTunes Store." Although Apple no longer uses FairPlay for music purchased on the iTunes Store, many subscription-based music services do use DRM technology to encrypt music downloaded for offline use. This allows them to revoke access to the music if the user cancels their subscription to the service. Similar technologies use encryption to provide Digital Rights Management for video games, movies, eBooks, and other entertainment content. Businesses also use DRM technology to protect their own intellectual property. They may purchase DRM solutions that allow them to control access to trade secrets and other sensitive business information, limit the redistribution of that information, and revoke the right to access information after a predetermined period of time. DRM plays an important role in preserving an organization's intellectual property rights, keeping it out of the hands of the competition and other adversaries.
