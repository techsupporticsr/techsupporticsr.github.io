# Asset Security
========================

![img](/img/02-00-01-01.png)


Hi, I'm Mike Chapple and I'd like to welcome you to our CISSP Asset Security course. 

The Certified Information System Security Professional, or CISSP certification, is the gold standard for information security certification. You'll find that it's a core requirement for many mid and senior level information security positions. Earning the CISSP requires demonstrating that you have sufficient work experience and passing an exam covering the eight domains of information security. This course covers the second of those eight domains, asset security. 10% of the questions on the CISSP exam come from this domain. I have two decades of experience as an information security professional and I've been involved in CISSP training and certification for most of those. As we work our way through this course, we'll focus on each topic covered by domain two. We'll review the concepts of data governance, including information classification and ownership. We'll also cover information security and privacy controls, including data handling requirements. You'll learn about the proper retention and disposal of sensitive information, and that's just a small sampling of the many topics covered in this course. These topics, combined with the information you learn in our other CISSP courses, will help you pass the CISSP exam and also provide a critical foundation for your career in information security. All right, let's get rolling.
